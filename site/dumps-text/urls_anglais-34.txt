'R54 800 per month': Kenyan judge declares that being a housewife is a
full-time job worthy of compensation

   "Raising children is a full-time job that families pay a person to
   do..."
   "Raising children is a full-time job that families pay a person to
   do..."

   A Kenyan high court judge has declared that being a housewife is a
   full-time job, and it should therefore attract some form of
   compensation.

   While presiding over a matrimonial dispute, Teresia Matheka, who is a
   Kenyan High Court Judge, said that it is unfair for courts to deny the
   contribution that housewives provide to the financial progress of the
   household.

   Though the exact details pertaining to the financial remuneration have
   not been officially finalised, the High Court ruled on 24 September
   2021 that a housewife should be paid a salary every month.

   'No less' than R54 800 per month

   The complainant in the respective judiciary matter was a divorced
   housewife who sought to have the family property sold and the
   reparations split equally between herself and her ex-husband.

   "It is easy for the spouse working away from home and sending money to
   lay claim to the whole property purchased and developed with that money
   by the spouse staying at home and taking care of the children and the
   family. That spouse will be heard to say that the other one was not
   employed so they contributed nothing," said Judge Matheka.

   Judge Matheka maintained that the services provided by a housewife
   should be considered work, as those tasks would otherwise be outsourced
   and paid for and stated that it would be unfair to constitute only
   monetary contributions to the household as valuable.

   In passing judgement on the matter, Judge Matheka ruled that the
   property be sold and the money shared equally, or that one spouse
   should buy out the other party by paying half the value of the property
   to the entitled party.

   'Pregnancy is equivalent to working'

   In addition to considering the value of the services rendered by a
   housewife, Judge Matheka urged her counterparts to consider the nine
   months of pregnancy when presiding over matrimonial matters, as she
   believes that pregnancy is equivalent to working, given that surrogates
   are hired and paid to bear children.

   On a Kenyan radio station, Kiss FM, presenter Kamene Goro weighed in on
   the matter on her morning show, stating that Kenyan housewives deserve
   no less than 400 000 Kenyan shillings as monthly compensation. This
   equates to approximately R54 800 per month.
   To drive her point home, Kamene shared that her previous marriage was a
   "tiresome experience", saying: "It's like a full-time job."

   "Raising children is a full-time job that families pay a person to do.
   Cooking and cleaning as well. Hence, for a woman in employment who has
   to balance childbearing and rearing this contribution must be
   considered," said Judge Matheka.

   know about spousal maintenance

   A monthly allowance for South African housewives?

   In South Africa, a housewife is not legally entitled to be compensated
   for services rendered, however, a court will take various factors into
   account to determine if a spouse is entitled to spousal maintenance
   after a divorce or separation.

   Spousal maintenance is the legal obligation on a person to provide
   financial support to his or her spouse before or after marital
   separation or divorce.
   The court has wide discretion when considering maintenance claims but
   ideally, spousal maintenance should enable you to maintain the same
   standard of living as during the marriage.

   Do you believe that this ruling could influence South African law one
   day, and become applicable here? Share your comments and questions via
