   COMMENTARY
   Politicizing the Housewife
   November 1, 2001
   By Wendy McElroy

   What it means to be a housewife is being revised ideologically in order
   to impugn the choice some mothers make to stay at home.

   The revisionism has been fueled by the recent case of Andrea Yates, the
   Texas mother who drowned her five young children in a bathtub. The
   murders were allegedly committed because Yates suffered from postpartum
   depression aggravated by being a stay-at-home mom.

   Cheryl L. Meyer, coauthor of the forthcoming book Mothers Who Kill
   Their Children and an associate professor of psychology at Wright State
   University, expressed a new feminist line on stay-at-home moms in an
   article at Womens Enews (June 27), a popular feminist Web site. Meyer
   wrote, The reality is that the mother who kills her child is every
   mother, any mother. In positing Yates as an Every Woman, Meyer
   continues, Most mothers just seem to understand how a woman could kill
   her child. When we target certain cases and try to ascertain how this
   particular mother could have killed her child, we mask the more
   important question, why dont more mothers do this?

   Marcia Wilkie, coauthor of Marie Osmonds autobiographical account of
   postpartum depression, intimately linked Americas sweetheart to the
   murderous Yates in a Newsweek article (July 2). In a column in the same
   issue, Playing God on No Sleep, the Pulitzerprize-winning Anna
   Quindlen argued that every mother secretly identified with killing her
   own children. She described the typical stay-at-home housewife this
   way: Shes tired, shes hot and shes been up all night throwing
   sheets into the washer because the smaller of her two boys has
   projectile vomiting so severe it looks like a special effect from The
   Exorcist. Oh, and shes nauseated, too, because since she already has
   two kids under the age of 5 it made perfect sense to have another, and
   shes four months pregnant. With housework added to the unsavory mix,
   this Every Woman lives on the verge of snapping and committing
   infanticide.

   A myth created by PC feminism is dying and a new one is being created
   to replace it. The dying myth is that women do not commit acts of
   domestic violence: men do.

   It has been well documented that wives assault husbands at
   approximately the same rate as husbands assault wives. The statistics
   regarding fatal child abuse are even more alarming. A Bureau of Justice
   report titled Murder in Families (NCJ 143498) surveyed murder cases
   tried in 1988 and discovered that 55 percent of defendants charged with
   killing their own children were women. The Third National Incidence
   Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS-3, 1996) from the Department of
   Health and Human Services reported that mothers perpetrate 78 percent
   of fatal child abuse. Even granting that women are usually the primary
   caregivers and thus have much more opportunity and motive to snap,
   these figures are alarmingly high. They are so high and the subject of
   so much attention that it is no longer credible to claim that women are
   nonviolent in the home.

   To preserve the image of women as victims of oppressive male society,
   however, PC feminists find it necessary to explain how the murder of a
   child by his or her mother is still the fault of men. The first step is
   to remove responsibility from the mother by blaming her acts on
   postpartum depression or some other insanity with which most women
   can identify. The second step is to castigate the traditional family
   with its stay-at-home mom as a breeding ground of pathology for women.
   Since PC feminists already decry the traditional family as a bastion of
   white male culture and a barrier to womens actualizing their
   potential, the next leap of logic is easy. Murdering moms are driven to
   violence by the men who impregnate them and trap them in the
   psychologically devastating role of housewife. Thus many voices in the
   media blame Andrea Yatess husbanda man whom no one has suggested was
   ever violenteven while they express sympathy for Andrea herself. They
   blame society for not recognizing Andreas plight.

Friedan Called into Question

   Interestingly, the current debate about housewifery comes at the same
   time as the validity of the book that sparked the original debate is
   being severely questioned. In 1963 Betty Friedans book The Feminine
   Mystique, spoke of the problem that has no name. Stated simply,
   domesticity denied housewives their humanity and potential, making them
   suffer both physically and mentally. Friedan described the typical 50s
   family as a comfortable concentration camp. Like camp inmates,
   suburban housewives had adjusted psychologically and become dependent,
   passive, childlike and lived at a lower human level.

   Selling millions of copies, The Feminine Mystique became a powerful
   force in shaping American culture and has been credited with inspiring
   Second Wave feminism. Certainly it led to Friedans co-founding of the
   National Organization for Women (1966). The book has taken its rightful
   place as an icon of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 70s
   during which women flooded out of the home into the university and the
   workplace. As women continued to read Friedans book, the idea of
   housewifery as a pathology was cemented to feminism.

   Recent works have thoroughly discredited Friedans arguments, the power
   of which was derived from claims of personal experience and the
   authorities she cited to support her claims. In his book Betty Friedan
   and the Making of the Feminine Mystique (1998), Daniel Horowitz
   explored Friedans background and debunked the myth that she ever
   represented the typical suburban housewife as she has persistently
   claimed. Friedan had been a staunch political activist on the communist
   left for decades before her first book appeared. Horowitzs analysis is
   all the more damning because as a leftist he is sympathetic to her
   politics. He argues that she hid her past because she was afraid of
   being persecuted during the McCarthy witch hunts. Whatever Friedans
   motives may have been, they make The Feminine Mystique appear
   disingenuous.

   In a 1973 article in the New York Times Magazine titled Up From the
   Kitchen Floor, Friedan claimed that when she wrote her book in the
   early 60s, I wasnt even conscious of the woman problem. Yet in 1951
   Betty Goldstein (Friedans maiden name) wrote an article titled UE
   [the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America] Drive on
   Wage, Job Discrimination Wins Cheers from Women Members (UE News,
   April 16) in which she reported on a labor meeting. Goldstein described
   the women as fighters who refuse any longer to be paid or treated as
   some inferior species by their bosses, or by any male workers who have
   swallowed the bosses thinking.

   The fact that readers of Friedans book identified with her as a
   sister-housewife who had naïvely bought into the domesticity myth was
   one reason for The Feminine Mystiques huge success. The same
   readership would never have identified with the real Friedan: a
   left-wing labor journalist; a member of Marxist discussion groups;
   author of the union pamphlet UE Fights for Women Workers (June 1952),
   which critiqued wage discrimination based on sex; a rent striker; and a
   career woman who hired a really good mother-substitutea
   housekeeper-nurse (Charm, April 1955).

   In an article titled Rethinking Betty Friedan and The Feminine
   Mystiquee: Labor Union Radicalism and Feminism in Cold War America
   (American Quarterly, March 1996), Horowitz argued that an examination
   of Friedans communist past and her subsequent shift toward
   respectability illustrates a significant turn within the ideology of
   the left in the 1950s. It is a microcosm of how the Old Left has
   evolved into the politically correct New Left. The ideology expanded
   from economic analysis, which was based on Marxism, to include
   humanistic psychology and a focus on the effect of consumption on
   the middle class. In his analysis, contemporary feminism is merely a
   subset of the New Left.

   In addition to questions about Friedans credentials as a housewife,
   grave doubt has been cast both on her interpretation of the experts on
   which The Feminine Mystique was based and the facts presented by the
   experts themselves. In the Atlantic Monthly (September 1999), Alan
   Wolfe, director of the Center for Religion and American Public Life at
   Boston College, raised the question of whether a book can arrive at
   the larger truths if the bricks on which it is built wont stand up to
   time.

   This question is particularly relevant to The Feminine Mystique, which
   relies heavily on appeals to authority, from psychologists such as
   Freud and Abraham Maslow to the anthropologist Margaret Mead and the
   sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.

   In using these experts, Friedan dips in and out of their work, citing
   the evidence that supports her position and ignoring whatever
   contradicts it. Even the supporting evidence no longer provides a real
   prop. In the years following publication of Friedans book, much of the
   selectively cited research has been discredited. For example, Derek
   Freemans book The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead: A Historical
   Analysis of Her Samoan Research (1999) effectively countered the claims
   made in Meads work Coming of Age in Samoaa book highly touted in The
   Feminine Mystique. The credibility of Kinsey has fared even worse as
   rampant bias in his methodology has been revealed.

   Wolfe concludes, To make her case that women required freedom, Friedan
   felt it necessary to exaggerate the degree to which they lived in
   slavery. Unfortunately for her argument, the treatment of a serious
   social problem which relies on the authority of experts appears far
   less persuasive if the experts turn out to be telling just-so stories.
   Without the backing of solid statistics and research, Friedans work
   does nothing more than offer anecdotal evidence of the unhappiness of
   some housewives and then proceeds to define the reality of most on that
   basis.

   Friedans credibility has fallen on hard times. Even the admiring
   biographer Judith Hennessee is strangely critical of her subject in the
   book Betty Friedan: Her Life (1999). In the introduction she admits
   being disappointed in Friedan the person as opposed to Friedan the
   thinker. Hennessee speaks of a feminist who was often rude and nasty
   and who . . . did not even like women; of a wife who inflicted and
   received so much violence in her marriage that her three children
   required therapy to distance themselves from the emotional fallout.

   Despite the criticism, however, it is undeniably true that The Feminine
   Mystique spoke to many women whose lives were changed as a result of
   reading the book. For them, being a housewife was a negation of their
   potential as human beings, and they discovered the courage to reach out
   to make a different choice. But voices within feminism were not content
   to view domesticity simply as a choice that appealed to some women and
   not to others. So a new political mythology of housewifery was born.

The Myth of the Housewife

   In the 60s the mainstream of feminism was liberal and contained a
   strong bias toward reforming marriage to make it more equal. For
   example, men were exhorted to do more of the housework and to share
   greater responsibility for child rearing. In short, The Feminine
   Mystique did not call for the abolition of marriage, merely for a
   transformation. Years later, when politically correct gender feminism
   built on Friedans work to argue for the abolition of marriage, she
   objected. In her book The Second Stage (1981) she explained that gender
   feminists were misinterpreting her meaning.

   She pleaded with them to move away from antifamily rhetoric and back to
   a dialogue with men about how to improve the institution of marriage.

   What is the substance of the antifamily rhetoric to which Friedan
   objected?

   The gender feminist assault on the traditional family, including
   stay-at-home moms, can be dated from Kate Milletts influential book
   Sexual Politics (1970). Milletts views were extreme and her
   presentation radical. For example, in dealing with male-female
   relations (sexual politics), Millett dwelt almost obsessively on
   pornography and sado-masochistic literature. In attacking sexual
   politics she assaulted the entire structure of power in societythat
   is, the white male culture known as patriarchy. Marriage was posited as
   the agency that maintained the traditional pattern of mans power over
   woman.

   Milletts work was followed up and fleshed out by other extreme voices.
   Consider a small sampling of some books that quickly ensued: Ellen
   Pecks The Baby Trap (1971) argued that babies block liberation;
   Kathrin Perutzs Marriage is Hell (1972) defined heterosexual sex as a
   political power struggle; Jill Johnstons Lesbian Nation (1973) called
   heterosexual females traitors. The popular anthology Sisterhood is
   Powerful (1970) contained 74 essays; only one of them had anything to
   do with motherhood.

   A new theory of the housewife was evolving in which the role had the
   political status of chattel. To gender feminists, marriage and the
   family became inextricably bound up with private property, the class
   structure, and the mode of production. In other words, the family was
   an aspect of capitalism.

   The seeds of their analysis are to be found in Friedrich Engels,
   coauthor of the Communist Manifesto and an author much quoted by
   Millett. In his book The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and
   the State (1884) Engels argued that the oppression of women sprang from
   the nuclear family, but he did not believe that this oppression had
   occurred throughout history. It had emerged with the dawn of capitalism
   before which, he claimed, the work of men and of women was valued
   equally. In the nineteenth century, however, industrialization
   supposedly brought a separation between home and productive work and
   caused a transfer of mens labor from the home or farm to the
   factories. Women remained at the hearth. Thus men came to dominate the
   public realm and women were confined to the private one. Although some
   women ventured into the factories as well, they received lower pay and
   their independence was illusory.

   With the emergence of wide-scale capitalism, women were said to be
   relegated to the roles of breeding, maintaining men, and buying
   consumer goods. Mothers provided the next and appropriately
   indoctrinated generation of laborers for the capitalists; housewives
   maintained the male workforce by cleaning and cooking; housekeepers
   enriched the capitalist structure by consuming the products it
   produced.

   As the early gender feminists Nicole Cox and Silvia Federici explained
   in their pamphlet Counter-Planning from the Kitchen: Wages for
   Housework, Housework . . . is servicing the wage earner physically,
   emotionally, sexually, getting him ready to work day after day for the
   wage. It is taking care of our children . . . and ensuring that they
   too perform in ways expected of them under capitalism.

   To gender feminists housework is a direct expression of mans
   oppression of women and capitalisms exploitation. As such, housework
   is surplus labor. To restate the feminist concept: Capitalism is a
   process by which those who own the means of production pay wages to
   workers who produce goods worth more than the wages paid. The worth in
   excess of the wages paid is called the surplus value of labor and it
   is absorbed by capitalists as unearned profit. The surplus value of
   housework is that it enables mens labor. Mens labor is the unearned
   profit that capitalism absorbs.

   Thrown into this economic condemnation of housework and the traditional
   family as bastions of capitalism are other accusations. For example,
   housewives are said to be kept in an isolation that encourages domestic
   violence.

   From such analysis sprang the popular feminist slogan The personal is
   political. Susan Moller Okin explained the origins in her book
   Justice, Gender, and the Family (1991). Okin wrote, The earliest
   claims that the personal is political came from those gender feminists
   of the 1960s and 1970s who argued that, since the family was at the
   root of womens oppression, it must be smashed. She disputes the
   assumption that family arrangements should be treated as personal,
   private matters rather than as political ones: the state can and should
   enter the domestic scene.

   To those who object, Okin replies that the state already intervenes by
   establishing the social and political background in which the family
   functions. Expanding the intervention by, for example, requiring
   payment for housework is a matter of degree, not of kind.

   Whether or not Friedan is comfortable with the manner in which her
   theories have been spun out, this is the logical conclusion to her
   calling the suburban household a concentration camp for women. And so
   the new myth appears: stay-at-home moms are oppressed women who are so
   psychologically damaged by being trapped that they are likely to snap
   under the pressure. As isolated victims of male society, it is
   understandable if they experience psychotic episodes in which they kill
   their own children. Indeed, in doing so, they are expressing their
   victimhood, which has gone unrecognized by society at large.

A New/Old View of Housewifery

   Fortunately, voices of sanity remain. One of them belongs to Mimi
   Gladstein who speaks out in the individualist feminist book [from The
   Independent Institute] Liberty for Women (Ivan R. Dee, spring 2002).
   Individualist feminism views staying at home to raise a family as a
   choice every bit as valid as entering the work force. Gladsteins essay
   begins, We dont hire housewives, because that is the response she
   received when she asked about joining the faculty of the University of
   Texas at El Paso, where she is now associate dean of liberal arts.
   Gladstein refused to be devalued as a human being because she was a
   housewife. That jobno less than teaching university
   Englishexpressed her worth and her competence. Even more, being a
   housewife was the training ground where she learned skills such as
   setting priorities and budgeting time. Gladstein writes, All I really
   needed to know about chairing a department, I learned by being a Jewish
   Mother.

   Gladstein describes how being a suburban housewife trained her to
   handle taking over as executive director of her universitys Diamond
   Jubilee celebration. She writes, That job allowed me to use my
   housewifery skills to create and manage events as diverse as football
   half-times, city-wide street festivals, physics fairs, student
   retention programs, Vietnam Memorial dedications, city and university
   planning commissions and a year-long program of national and internally
   renowned speakers. She learned the necessary skills while juggling her
   childrens schedules, planning the family budget, and being a hostess
   at her husbands business events.

   Choice is the key to individualist feminism and to whether or not
   housework is damaging to women. To those women who choose to stay home
   and raise a family, it can be not only the most fulfilling use of their
   time, but it can also teach management skills that translate well into
   the workplace afterwards. In approaching marriage and the family, the
   feminist slogan should be: the personal is personal. Individuals
   should choose, and the state should have no role.
