   A newly formed political party in India, launched by a film star, has
   promised salaries to housewives if voted to power. A prominent MP
   welcomed the idea, saying it will "monetise the services of women
   homemakers, enhance their power and autonomy" and create a
   near-universal basic income.

   This is a compelling debate, especially at a time when women are losing
   ground in paid work. All around the world, women spend time in unpaid
   work - ranging from a maximum of 345 minutes per day in Iraq to 168
   minutes per day in Taiwan, according to International Labour
   Organisation. On average, men spent 83 minutes in unpaid care work
   while women spent three times more at 265 minutes.

   So should housewives be paid wages for doing largely thankless
   household chores?

   India's 160 million homemakers, like many of their counterparts in the
   rest of the world, clean, tidy, cook, wash up and manage family
   finances. They fetch food, water and firewood, and give care to
   children and their in-laws. They spend 297 minutes a day doing domestic
   work, compared to 31 minutes by men. A quarter of men are engaged in
   unpaid chores, compared to four-fifths of women.

   Legal scholar Gautam Bhatia has argued that unpaid housework is "forced
   labour". Arpan Tulsiyan, a research scholar at Delhi University, says
   it is "important to recognise the value of unpaid domestic work".

   What is not well known is that for more than half-a-century, Indian
   courts have actually been awarding compensation for unpaid work done by
   homemakers. But only after their death.

   Housework has traditionally been treated as a woman's responsibility in
   India

   Prabha Kotiswaran, a professor of law and justice at King's College
   London, has looked at about 200 cases between 1968 and 2021 filed under
   an Indian law that regulates all road transport vehicles and imposes
   penalties for rash driving, among other things.

   She found that the country's courts had developed a "path-breaking"
   legal framework concerning "robust wages for housework": judges have
   put a value on unpaid work of women who have died in road accidents and
   awarded compensation to their dependants.

   In calculating the value of housework, judges have looked at
   opportunity cost - which is something that is given up in order to do
   something else - of a woman's decision to work at home, considered
   minimum wages for skilled and unskilled workers, taken into account
   educational qualifications of the deceased woman, and adjusted
   compensations after accounting for age and considering whether she had
   children or not.

   In December, a court awarded a compensation of 1.7 million rupees
   ($23,263; £17,019) to the family of a 33-year-old homemaker who died in
   a road accident, after fixing her notional salary at 5,000 rupees a
   month.

   The Supreme Court has awarded lump sum amounts up to 9,000 rupees a
   month as a notional income for a deceased housewife aged between 34-59
   years with a lower amount for elderly women, aged between 62-72.
   Compensation decreased with age as courts believed she would be doing
   less childcare work as children grew up.

   Wherever possible, the judges have tried to keep pace with inflation.
   In one judgement, the judges viewed marriage as an "equal economic
   partnership" so that the homemaker's salary would be half of the
   husband's salary.

   The earliest case of such compensation found by Prof Kotiswaran was a
   ruling from 1966. In that case, the court ruled that the cost to the
   husband of "maintaining" his wife would have been equal to her imagined
   salary, so no compensation was awarded to him.

   Some of the compensation payments calculated by the courts have been
   "paltry", Prof Kotiswaran says, but "the principle itself of the
   recognition of unpaid work on par with an occupation is quite
   noteworthy".

   It begs the question: if a family can be compensated for unpaid work
   done by a woman after she has died, why not pay women when they are
   alive?

   Lawyers may be able to use these judgments to "trigger developments in
   constitutional law and family laws to recognise the unpaid work of
   housewives in normal times, rather than only at times of disruption",
   Prof Kotiswaran says. Paying wages to women doing unpaid work at home
   would also boost India's declining female labour participation rate.

   "I am not arguing only for salaries for housewives, but for a broader
   wages-for-housework movement. Organisations like UN Women are too
   focused on how unpaid work is an obstacle to paid work," Prof
   Kotiswaran says. "The focus seems to be on how to get more women into
   paid work. The Indian women's movement is focused on many laudable
   issues but is not asking the big question here about labour performed
   within marriage."

   There's also no mass mobilisation of housewives over the issue, she
   says. "Most elites think that salaries for housewives is unworkable at
   best and regressive at worst, but there is a case for a broader
   political argument about recognition of housework. I do think that
   women in millions of Indian households, subject to the drudgery of
   maintaining home, will welcome a proposal for salaries."

   There are a lot of questions about how this can be achieved.

   Should the money for the wages come from cash transfers, state
   subsidies or a universal basic income? Should family laws be changed to
   recognise women's unpaid work? Should men performing housework also be
   remunerated? Should transgender women be included in these payment
   schemes? What could be the unintended consequences of salaries for
   housewives?

   "We need a more sustained conversation on all of these aspects before
   mobilising for salaries for housewives," says Prof Kotiswaran.
