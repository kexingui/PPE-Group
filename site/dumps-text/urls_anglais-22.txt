Unpacking ‘Housewife’ And Its Problematic Implications

   Housewife as a word is complicit in the erasure of agency of married
   women by defining them in terms of their relationships and the domestic
   obligations that correspond.
   By Rohitha Naraharisetty Jan 7, 2019 4 min read

   The word ‘housewife’ is the product of the marriage (pun intended)
   between capitalism and patriarchy, where breaking the word up yields
   two of the factors from each ideology which ultimately determine a
   woman’s social location. ‘House’ indicates the site of labour – the
   private sphere, and with ‘wife’ being an ascribed status in relation to
   a man legally bound as a husband through the marriage contract. Put
   together, the words naturalises the role of a married woman as the one
   to perform unpaid domestic labour in the home.

   In other words, being a wife and performing unpaid labour become
   synonymous with each other. Housewife as a word is complicit in the
   erasure of agency of married women by defining them in terms of their
   relationships and the domestic obligations that correspond. Recognition
   of the word’s implications for nullifying self determination and agency
   renders it incompatible with a feminist politics which works to
   dismantle structural conditions of oppression, with language playing a
   key role in the same.

     Work ascribed to women is not only valued less but also cheapened
     with the help of patriarchy which privileges masculinity over
     femininity.

   In order to unpack why ‘housewife’ is a problematic word, the idea of
   ‘work’ must be problematised. One of the key ideas that capitalism
   tries to sell is the equation of financial capital with agency. What is
   left unquestioned is the kind of work which is monetarily valued under
   capitalism and the kind which is not. Most often, work ascribed to
   women according to traditional gender roles are not only valued less,
   it is also cheapened with the help of the patriarchy which privileges
   masculinity over femininity. As a result, the work which women do, or
   are associated with doing, is valued less and feminine labour such as
   care-work and domestic chores become relegated to the unpaid or lesser
   paid end of the work spectrum.

   Traditionally, masculine jobs are paid for and have hence been defined
   over time as ‘work’ as per a capitalist definition which incorporates
   income and profit into its logics. To then use the word housewife for
   women who don’t “work”, therefore, is to not only leave the idea of
   work unproblematised, it is also actively playing into a capitalist
   patriarchal ideology which requires a whole section of people’s work to
   be undervalued and therefore unpaid in order to sustain the machinery
   of production and profit.

     If a wife’s duty, according to gender norms, is to sustain the
     family, the work which she does in the house in order to do so is
     her natural role and must therefore not be paid for.

   The word also serves the essential function of devaluing domestic
   labour itself; by setting it up as oppositional to ‘actual work’, it
   implicitly negates the use value of work performed at home in order to
   make it sound logical to not have this work be paid for. If a wife’s
   duty, according to gender norms, is to sustain the family, the work
   which she does in the house in order to do so is her natural role and
   must therefore not be paid for. The naturalisation of this work also
   allows for it to be viewed as unskilled work, and further contributes
   to the devaluation of the same.

   Ultimately, the word comes with all of these implications in order to
   justify not paying for or recognising domestic labour as real work.
   Additionally, the word allows for the privatisation of care and
   domestic labour due to the fact that reinforcing the easy congruity
   between housework and being a wife enables the state or governing
   entity to relegate this to the private sphere and not view it as worthy
   of public investment.

   The implications of the word in lieu of all of these hidden meaning,
   therefore, are many. It reinforces the public/private divide which is
   often cited by many feminist scholars as a distinction that excludes
   women from integrating into civil society by confining them to their
   traditional gender roles within the private sphere.

   It is also not gender neutral, as unpaid labour in the home as the
   domain of the work that housewives do is specific to women; with its
   association with femininity, men escape the devaluation and therefore
   do not have a commonly used counterpart to the word housewife. The word
   when used for women ties in capitalist exploitation with patriarchal
   subordination to create an identity which does not allow for thinking
   about these women as having agency of their own.

     When being a ‘housewife’ is associated with “not working,” the
     importance of domestic labour in sustaining capitalism is swept
     aside and women are made to feel devalued as subjects themselves.

   While unpaid domestic work must be challenged for its devaluation, the
   power dynamics within an employer-employee relationship under
   capitalism may have the harmful potential to exacerbate women’s
   subordination in their roles as wives. It must be noted that the
   function which unpaid labour performs for capitalist patriarchy is
   reproduction of labour power, or work which allows for someone else to
   re-enter the workforce to engage in paid labour everyday. When being a
   ‘housewife’ is associated with ‘not working’, the importance of
   domestic labour in sustaining capitalism is swept aside and women are
   made to feel devalued as subjects themselves.

   There is therefore a need for a new word which recognises these
   inconsistencies with respect to feminist practice, which would then
   interrogate the conditions leading to devaluation of work instead of
   allowing the same to sustain themselves through the word. While
   ‘homemaker’ is one such alternative that has gained mainstream traction
   and does away with the ‘wife’ suffix, it still does not address the
   fact that capitalism relies on the devaluation of this work and of the
   people who do it in order to perpetuate itself, and once again leaves
   the oppressive origins of such work unproblematised.

   Also read: Unpaid Domestic Labour and the Invisibilisation of Women’s
   Work

   A new word for unpaid domestic labour can be conceptualised once the
   question of work itself is deconstructed, which may then address the
   question of ascribing value to different kinds of work according to
   gender norms and stereotype.

       nice. I’m writing a book about gender and domestic labour in the
       global context and fully agree with the feminist power of
       phrase-making

            Hi, thank you for your comment! Phrase-making indeed plays a
            vital role toward creating and sustaining discourses which can
            solidify gendered realities. Interested to know more about
            your book.

       Eye opening article! Thank you. I suggest we replace the term
       “Housewife” with “Equal Life Partner.”

            Thanks for the comment! That’s an interesting suggestion; I
            was thinking more along the lines of a word that would do away
            with the idea of ‘housewife’ as an identity in itself. 🙂

       Completely agree…I being in and out of job would recommend ‘Home
       Manager’ as an appropriate title as it is actually managing the
       entire home affairs and it’s no joke. In fact the outside home
       working partners must lawfully hand over a salary for that!!
