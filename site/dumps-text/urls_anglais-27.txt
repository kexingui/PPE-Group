   Housewife 'would be paid £30,000'

   Clothes Pegs
   Nearly three-quarters of those polled said it was a full-time job

   Housewives would be paid more than the average worker if they received
   the going rate for their household chores, a survey has suggested.

   A poll of 4,000 housewives for networking website alljoinon.com
   suggested that the average mum worked for nearly nine hours a day every
   day.

   The website said a housewife would earn almost £30,000 a year if she
   was employed to do all the same errands.

   The average annual UK wage is £23,700, according to official figures.

   Some 71% of those polled agreed that successfully running the family
   home was a full-time job.

   "The survey clearly demonstrates that not only do housewives deserve a
   wage for their efforts, they also need a break from the daily grind,"
   said Carolyn Morris, spokeswoman for alljoinon.com.

   The chores are yours

   An average mum would spend 273 minutes every day looking after the
   children, according to the poll. Based on an hourly rate of £8, a nanny
   would earn £36.80 a day for the same job.

   The survey claims 71 minutes a day is spent cleaning and tidying

   Cleaning and tidying for 71 minutes would net a cleaner £7.10 a day.
   For more than an hour of cooking a head chef would get £17.30.

   Fourteen minutes making the beds is worth £1.29 for a chambermaid, and
   a kitchen assistant would be paid £2.57 for a housewife's typical 28
   minutes of washing up.

   The poll said the average mum trawled the family finances for 39
   minutes, which would cost £12.50 if an accountant did it.

   A taxi driver would earn £2.53 for the 23 minutes of ferrying children
   around, and a mystery shopper £2.10 for the 18 minutes a day of grocery
   shopping.

   Single women 'do less'

   HAVE YOUR SAY

     Would you really want to put a price on your wife? I'd rather pitch
     in and do my fair share.

   Last year, a study said that employed women living with their employed
   partner spent more time doing housework than single women.

   Labour economist Helene Couprie, of Toulouse University, concluded that
   on average, an employed woman does 15 hours a week of housework when
   she lives with her employed partner, up from 10 hours when single.

   Men, on the other hand, see the hours they commit to housework decline
   once they begin living as a couple, she found.

   In the year to April 2007, average earnings of full-time male employees
   were £498 per week, while for women it was £394, according to the
   Office of National Statistics.
