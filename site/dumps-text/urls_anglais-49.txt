   PUTRAJAYA: A total of 1,092 housewives have registered under the
   Housewives Social Security Scheme (SKSSR), says V. Sivakumar.

   The Human Resources Minister said the number was recorded in the first
   seven days since the scheme was implemented on Dec 1.

   The ministry, he said, targeted 500,000 registrations from the total
   2.9 million housewives by next year.

   “The initiative is open to all Malaysian citizens and permanent
   residents, aged below 55, with no minimum age limit for those who wish
   to contribute.

   “Housewives eligible for the scheme will have to contribute RM120 per
   year in advance to receive domestic disaster benefits and invalidity
   benefits for 12 months,” he told a press conference yesterday.

   Benefit payments under the scheme range from RM200 to RM50,000,
   depending on the types of benefits and injuries.

   Among the benefits under both protections are medical, permanent
   disability, constant-attendance-allowance, facilities for physical or
   dialysis, funeral benefits and survivors’ pension.

   Sivakumar said the scheme would also cover housewives when they were
   outside their house to perform domestic duties such as picking up their
   children from the school or accidents while shopping for groceries.

   He said SKSSR was different from commercial insurance as it provides a
   low premium but offers a wider coverage.

   The scheme is also open to all including those with pre-existing health
   problems.

   Sivakumar also said SKSSR differs from i-Suri, which does not cover
   non-working women.

   Those who wish to register under the scheme can do so via the Social
   Security Organisation (Socso) website. Payment can be done online or at
   all Socso counters.
