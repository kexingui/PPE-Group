Help from housewives turns hobby into business
       World 22h ago

Hundreds of trucks snarl Bolivia farm region as blockades hit business

   Mositol (right) introducing the different types of herbs to some
   housewives in Ranau.

   KOTA KINABALU: A farmer who tried her hand at planting herbs and edible
   flowers as a hobby has turned it into a source of income not only for
   herself, but a group of housewives in Ranau district as well.

   Irene Mositol, 31, founder of DumoWongi (scented farm), now has more
   than 70 people working with her.

   She buys fresh produce from local planters and handles the packaging,
   quality control and marketing.

   She was recently named grand winner for the Social Impact Category in
   the 2022 Shell LiveWIRE global Top 10 Innovators Award, an
   entrepreneurial competition which rewards entrepreneurs who demonstrate
   excellence in innovation.

   The mother of one won US$20,000 (RM89,600) after beating 195
   entrepreneurs from 17 participating countries around the world.

   Mositol said she initially wanted to get into vegetable farming.

   “However, when officials from Shell came to visit my farm in Bundu
   Tuhan for an inspection as I had signed up to be part of the LiveWIRE
   programme, they saw that I also had several pots of herbs,” she said in
   a recent interview.

   She said they asked why she did not want to cultivate herbs instead as
   there was high demand in the food and beverage industry and very few
   people were doing it in Sabah.

   Mositol then decided to just give it a try, learning about cultivating
   herbs through the Internet step by step.

   She bought the potted herbs from another farmer in Kundasang, and tried
   to get more varieties from other sources including supermarkets.

   “I started it as a hobby at the end of 2018 and only got serious during
   the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said.

   The temperature and weather in places like Bundu Tuhan and Kundasang
   are cooler because they are located in the highlands.

   Mositol said with effort and focus, she started seeing the potential
   and monetary returns, prompting curious housewives to enquire and
   subsequently start planting herbs as well.

   They started out with herbs like rosemary, thyme and oregano before
   expanding to edible flowers.

   They have fresh as well as dried herbs packed in bottles for sale.

   Mositol herself now has over 40 types of herbs and edible flowers
   planted around her farm, and manages her own processing house.

   “I am glad that what I am doing has an economic impact on other women
   as well, because as we know, the pandemic really hit hard and many are
   struggling financially,” she said.

   She added that with assistance from companies such as Shell, they
   learned to improve their business and standard of living.

   Asked about the challenges faced by herb farmers like herself, Mositol
   counted the lack of local planters, weather conditions, and information
   on plant diseases among some of them.

   “At the moment, we are faced with a type of plant disease and are
   trying to find local solutions and formulas to stop its spread, as it
   can affect the growth and quality of our herbs and edible flowers,” she
   added.
