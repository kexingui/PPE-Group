Sarawak cops enlist housewives to help eradicate crime
     __________________________________________________________________

     * Sabah & Sarawak
     * Saturday, 27 Aug 2022
       7:23 PM MYT

   SIBU: Sarawak police will mobilise the participation of housewives in
   the state to combat crime in housing estates through the Sarawak
   contingent’s Amanita (special female personnel unit) housing estate
   adoption programme which was launched on Saturday (Aug 27).

   Sarawak police commissioner Datuk Mohd Azman Ahmad Sapri (pic) said the
   garden adoption initiative aims to increase the involvement of police
   officers to be closer to residents in housing areas as well as
   communicating with housewives in an effort to prevent crime.

   He said Amanita was a special unit under the police that was
   established in March 2013 to obtain information related to unreported
   crimes in the community in an effort to help the police reduce crime
   rates.

   "Amanita officers will hold a collaboration between policewomen and
   housewives. This Amanita housing estate adoption initiative will also
   make the residential area a safer place.

   "This cooperation is expected to help the police in terms of channeling
   information related to crime. If they find that there are suspicious
   things happening in the surrounding area, they can contact them
   directly and report to the police immediately," he said at the launch
   of the Taman Kemuyang Amanita Housing Estate Adoption Programme here
   Saturday.

   Comm Azman said housewives were the right group to pass on information
   to the police because they are always at home and are aware of the
   happenings in their neighbourhood.

   "So, they have the right to be given a mandate to jointly prevent local
   crime by reporting to the police," he explained and added that the
   selection criteria for adoption was based on the crime index in an
   area.

   He added that by making Kemuyang Park an Amanita adopted area, it will
   not only benefit the local residents but surrounding areas estimated to
   have around 5,000 residents as well. - Bernama
