Marching On: A Review of “Little Women” at First Folio Theatre

   As a social barometer, Louisa May Alcott’s mid-nineteenth-century
   coming-of-age novel, “Little Women,” holds up. Although performed often
   as a play, the ostensible equality of women to men in modern-day
   society justifies every recurrence.

   The most recent iteration of “Little Women” to hit the Chicago area is
   presented by First Folio Theatre at the Mayslake Peabody Estate in Oak
   Brook. After twenty-six years, founding executive director David Rice
   is retiring and closing the company, making “Little Women” the
   third-to-last production of the final season.

   The lives of the four March sisters are framed by dark mahogany wood
   beams and numerous nooks filled to bursting with books in a spacious
   attic. Jo (Shelby Lynn Bias) is independent, a voracious reader and
   aspiring writer. Oldest sister Meg (Stephanie Fongheiser) is Jo’s
   near-opposite, content to marry and become a housewife. Third-oldest
   Beth (Jamie Herb) resembles a Dickensian heroine—subdued, angelic,
   trying to please everyone—too good for this world. The youngest sister,
   Amy (Esther Fishbein), is a brat, who grows to become a mature-ish
   artist.

   Each personality trait is amplified to the maximum, making the girls
   appear more childish than their ages—Amy, who should be twelve years
   old, comes across as seven or eight, a developmental drop that afflicts
   all characters. But the chemistry feels right, and interactions, though
   highly animated, come off as genuine and heartfelt.

   The actors perform double duty, with everyone except Bias playing both
   a sister and a male love interest. Fishbein briefly steps into the
   shoes of Meg’s future husband, John Brooke, and Fongheiser manages a
   German-ish accent as Professor Bhaer.

   Herb plays Laurie, Jo’s eager, wide-eyed childhood boyfriend, who
   not-so-secretly pines for her throughout their friendship. Among fans
   there is an ongoing debate whether Jo should have married Laurie or
   not. This production is unambiguous in asserting that Jo would never
   have been happy with such an immature and whiny partner, and why she
   winds up falling for the older Professor Bhaer.

   Two visual metaphors are used to great effect. While in Paris, Amy uses
   inflatable red balloons to symbolize her art, releasing every work she
   deems not a masterpiece to be sent squealing and twisting through the
   air. In the most brilliant scene in the production, new housewife Meg
   loses her mind while attempting to make currant jam, with lightweight
   juggling scarves representing how many things she has “up in the air.”

   Director Melanie Keller moves the show along at a quick pace that keeps
   the viewer enthralled. The adaptation, written by Heather Chrisler,
   contains a few big twists that Alcott would approve of.

   Today, the phrase “what is a woman” is a slur used by men on television
   and in politics to denigrate others. The women in “Little Women,”
   defined so clearly in First Folio Theatre’s recent production, show
   that womanhood exists on a spectrum. It’s sad that we—mostly men—need
   this reminder, but that is why works like this are so important, and
   why performers and audiences return to them again and again.

   “Little Women” at First Folio Theatre Company at Mayslake Peabody
   Estate, 1717 31st Street in Oak Brook, firstfolio.org, (630)986-8067.
   Tickets are $49-$59 with discounts for seniors and students.
