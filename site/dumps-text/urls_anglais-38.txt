   Maryam Habibu, an 18-year-old housewife, has been arrested by the
   police in Katsina State for allegedly drowning her four-year-old
   stepson in a well in the Kafur Local Government Area of the state.

   Habibu, who is from Leko village in the Danja Local Government Area
   was, alongside 11 other suspects held for various offences, ranging
   from banditry, kidnapping to cattle rustling, paraded on Friday at the
   Police Command Headquarters, Katsina.

   SP Gambo Isah, the command’s spokesman, while briefing newsmen during
   the parade, explained that the teenage housewife was arrested on
   November 9, 2022.

   He further explained that she allegedly lured the boy out and threw him
   inside a well.

   According to the PPRO, Habibu and the victim’s father were an estranged
   couple.

   Habibu, who spoke to newsmen in Hausa, admitted to the crime, saying it
   was destiny at play.

   According to her, “It’s true I threw the boy inside the well where he
   died but it has been destined that he would die on that day. That is
   why he died.”
