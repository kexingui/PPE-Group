Infinities of being a housewife

Why her ‘job’ is perhaps the most magnanimous one in the world

   When my cousin sister was seven years old, my father, at a family
   gathering, put her on his lap and asked her, “So little girl, what do
   you want to be when you grow up?” She put on a pensive face as she
   mulled over the question. Finally, her eyes brightened as she pointed a
   finger at her mother and squealed, “A housewife!”

   For a moment, every soul listening to that seemingly innocuous exchange
   was stunned into silence, which was broken only by the guttural
   laughter of my aunt’s father-in-law, my cousin’s paternal grandfather.
   “Sweet child! That’s not a profession. The job of a housewife is hardly
   a job. It’s a duty.”

   We live in the 21st century. As a country we proudly highlight our
   progress by citing the existence of a burgeoning female workforce, one
   that includes highly educated and skilled professionals. Yet, we cannot
   deny the fact that a majority of Indian women still do not go out to
   work. Instead, they work at home. Not from home as entrepreneurs or
   freelancers, but rather in their houses, as housewives.

   At the core of every family, nuclear or joint, is the housewife. The
   importance of her physical presence is underscored by the stasis the
   household comes to when she is not around. She single-handedly runs it,
   juggling chores such as cooking, washing, cleaning and caretaking with
   great skill.

   Emotionally, she holds the family together. She is a pillar of support
   for her husband, a guiding light for her child, and a harbour for the
   family’s elderly. It’s as though her existence is entirely selfless,
   always putting the interests of others over and above her own.

   There is hardly any difference between the ‘job’ description of a
   housewife and that of the chief executive officer of a company. While
   the CEO steers a company forward, the housewife is at the helm of the
   household. The CEO may work 12 hours a day, taking important decisions
   in the field of production, sales, finance and human resources. The
   housewife is just as able an administrator. She, in fact, works
   round-the-clock. She also deals with physical, financial and human
   resources. Her decisions affect the lives of people and the well-being
   of the home. However, the work she does is not quite considered a
   ‘job’. A CEO gets paid in millions, while her work just goes
   unacknowledged. She rarely even receives gratitude; remuneration, then,
   seems like a ridiculous idea.

   The patriarchal understanding of the role of a housewife is that her
   job is a duty. She has to perform these tasks on a daily basis,
   irrespective of whether she likes it or wants to do it at all. Her job
   is thankless. But then again, her job is not a job. Her skills are not
   marketable; she is not the breadwinner of the house. In its blunt
   interpretation of this metaphor, our male chauvinistic society has
   failed to realise that while the man may bring home the bread, it is
   the woman, or the housewife, who actually makes the food that he eats
   out of that bread.

   A housewife wants nothing more than to be treated with love, respect,
   gratefulness and dignity. Her ‘job’ is perhaps the most magnanimous one
   in the world. It’s time society woke up to her domestic significance,
   instead of taking her for granted. She deserves her due and it’s up to
   us to change regressive mindsets, celebrate her place in the familial
   ecosystem and recognise her noble, yet silent toil.
