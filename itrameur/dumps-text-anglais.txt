   STOCKHOLM — When the Swedish journalist Peter Letmark tried to track
   down a housewife for a series on 21st-century parents in the newspaper
   Dagens Nyheter recently, he failed.

   “Housewives,” he explained, “are a near-extinct species in Sweden. And
   the few who still do exist don’t really dare to go public with it.”

   In neighboring Norway, the Housewives’ Association changed its name to
   the Women and Family Association as its membership plummeted to 5,000
   from 60,000. “The reference to housewife was just too embarrassing,”
   said the feminist economist Charlotte Koren of the Norwegian Institute
   of Social Research, a former member and mother of two.

   When it is no longer socially acceptable to be a housewife — or
   homemaker, in modern American parlance — has feminism overshot its
   objective?

   In the 1950s, women were expected to stay at home, and those who wanted
   to work were often stigmatized. Today it’s mostly the other way round,
   pitting women against one another along the fault lines of conviction,
   economic class and need, and, often, ethnicity.

   Across the developed world, women who stay home are increasingly seen
   as old-fashioned and an economic burden to society. If their husbands
   are rich, they are frequently berated for being lazy; if they are
   immigrants, for keeping children from learning the language and ways of
   their host country.

   Their daily chores of cleaning, cooking or raising their children have
   always been ignored by national accounts. (If a man marries his
   housekeeper and stops paying her for her work, G.D.P. goes down. If a
   woman stops nursing and buys formula for her baby, G.D.P. goes up.) In
   a debate that counts women catching up with men in education and the
   labor market in terms of raising productivity and economic growth,
   stay-at-home moms are valued less than ever. This is so despite the
   fact that from Norway to the United States, economists put the value of
   their unpaid work ahead of that of the manufacturing sector.

   In countries where mothers still struggle to combine career with family
   and quit work less out of conviction than out of necessity, they are
   often doubly punished. In Germany, the biggest economy in Europe, most
   schools still finish at lunchtime, and full-time nurseries for children
   under 3 are scarce. Yet in this generation of young mothers you are
   more likely to find women saying they are on extended maternity leave
   or between jobs than admitting they are housewives.

   Only among the wealthy is it seen as class status when the highly
   educated mother takes children to Chinese or violin lessons.

   “It’s hard to find a balance between not romanticizing and not
   stigmatizing housewives,” said Nancy Folbre, a professor of economics
   at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. “Even though a number of
   women still stay at home, a cultural shift has put them on the
   defensive.”

   Bearing in mind that women now work both because they want to and
   because most families need two incomes, she said, “That’s the way
   social norms work: They put pressure on people to conform.”

   In Sweden the demise of the housewife is striking. Fathers share
   parental leave, kindergartens are heavily subsidized, and the universal
   breadwinner model is quite deeply entrenched — from the workplace to
   popular culture.

   Once the key market for advertisers on daytime television, happy
   homemakers touting cleaning products now rarely feature in TV ads.

   They are a “nonexistent segment,” said Jonas Andersson, brand
   consultant at The Brand Union, a Swedish brand design company. From
   time to time international ads have to be re-dubbed to remove offensive
   mentions of a “housewife,” he said. Mr. Andersson and his colleagues
   focus on what he calls the “women short of time” segment.

   “From chocolate to cars, you want to target working mothers,” he said.

   Nordic politicians have long focused on working mothers, giving them
   subsidies for elderly care and child care and, more recently, financial
   incentives to share parental leave.

   Over all, these policies have increased economic growth, raised tax
   revenue and given women who wanted to work more financial independence,
   more social benefits, more personal fulfillment — in short, what many
   would call more freedom.

   But social engineering is a blunt tool, and some worry that the freedom
   of working mothers has come at the expense of making outcasts of a
   minority who want to do things differently.

   Jorun Lindell, a mother of three and the wife of a Swedish
   entrepreneur, tried being a housewife and could not make it work.
   “Sneered at,” she said, for her conviction that her children should
   have their mother at home, she learned that she also could not put them
   into state day care a few hours every day or week because it was
   reserved for families where both parents are either working, looking
   for work or studying.

   She ended up enrolling at a university without any interest in her
   course, “wasting resources to get something our taxes already pay for,”
   she said.

   There is no easy way to right the unintended consequences of
   well-meaning policy.

   Some measures, like the home care allowance Sweden and Norway pay
   stay-at-home parents who opt out of the day care system, have often
   only reinforced the stigma attached to housewives: concerns that this
   allowance, popular with working-class and immigrant families, hampers
   social mobility by keeping children of poor and foreign backgrounds out
   of socializing day care have made it controversial.

   A cheaper and possibly more effective way might be to finally and
   formally recognize the contribution housewives make to the economy,
   said Hélène Périvier, an economist at the Institut d’Études Politiques
   in Paris.

   “It’s not about being paid,” said Ms. Périvier, noting that the
   economic value housewives create remains within their home, “it’s about
   being valued.”

   If ever there was a time to include unpaid housework and care work in
   G.D.P. figures, it is now, she said. Working mothers have a stake in
   this, too: They still do most of the unpaid work in their homes — even
   in Sweden.

Abstract

   This article attempts to demonstrate how the community subsidizes a
   married couple in which the wife stays at home, through the combined
   effect of tax and social security privileges. Contrary to what might be
   thought, this system is not even really designed to protect ‘the
   family’: it operates irrespective of whether there are any children or
   not. It is in fact intended to reward the couple in which the wife
   devotes herself to looking after her husband. It is quite likely that
   women who go out to work (and who also do their housework) bear more
   than their share of the cost of this, because of the ‘overpayments’
   that they are obliged to make in taxation and social security
   contributions. I propose that the system be abolished, as it
   corresponds to an out-of-date concept of marriage and has no
   justification from either the economic or the social standpoint. A
   housewife receives an income from her marriage and, if she actually
   does the housework, she improves the couple's standard of living. A
   number of working hypotheses are put forward in an attempt to see how
   the housewife could assume the normal responsibilities of a taxpayer
   and social security contributor.

   It is impossible (a) to assess the value of the services provided by
   the housewife in her sheltered environment and (b) even to know for
   certain what she really does there (many housewives employ charwomen or
   au pair girls or even full-time servants). However, when it is a
   question of granting to a widow an income related to what she had when
   her husband was alive, she is entitled to a specified fraction –
   usually half – of what her husband received or would have received. If
   this principle is valid with respect to benefits, it ought also to be
   valid with respect to obligations. Thus, the main proposal made here is
   that the housewife should pay income tax and social security
   contributions on a fictitious amount equivalent to half of her
   husband's earnings; this amount would be treated as ‘earned income’,
   which is the most favourable assumption from her standpoint. At the
   same time, the husband would pay income tax and his own social security
   contributions on the whole of his own earned income, as he would if he
   employed a housekeeper. The above-mentioned fictitious amount would
   also serve as the basis of calculation of the housewife's entitlement
   to social security benefits, subject to redistribution so as to assure
   a minimum subsistence in case of need. Reforms along these lines could
   only be put into effect gradually, since it would be unjust to penalize
   people from one day to the next for irresponsible behaviour which they
   have been deliberately encouraged to adopt up to the present.

   ^13 This penalization takes two main forms; either the wife's earnings
   are added to those of her husband and are thus taxed at a higher rate
   than would be justified if they were taxed separately, or else the
   earnings of the husband and the wife are taxed separately but at the
   higher rate, which is that generally applied to the earnings of single
   people at the same level of income. A man whose wife has no outside
   employment is in the last analysis the only beneficiary of the regime
   theoretically established for ‘married people’. A few countries have
   eliminated differences in tax rates and levels of taxable income based
   on marital status. In Great Britain, there is a difference in the
   personal allowance deductible from taxable income, which is higher for
   the ‘married man’; in addition, when she receives earned income, a
   married woman is granted a lower earned income relief than her husband.

   ^32 The proposal could be construed as establishing an automatic
   correspondence between a housewife, on the one hand, and the cost of
   looking after children in the absence of the parents, on the other
   hand; it is based on the above-mentioned confusion arising from the
   attempt to justify the privileges granted to a housewife on the ground
   of the existence of children.

   Divorced Persons, International Social Security Association, Round
   Table Meeting on Social Security Provisions in Case of Divorce,
   mimeograph, Geneva, 29 June – 1 07 1977.Google Scholar In the Federal
   Republic of Germany couples divorcing after 1 July 1977 share on an
   equal basis all the pension credits which have been accumulated at the
   time of divorce by either spouse during the years of marriage; pension
   credits are assigned on that basis to the account of the wife who has
   not been employed. As the scheme is earnings-related, the future
   old-age pension of the divorced husband will in this case undergo a
   corresponding reduction. A similar system of splitting pension credits
   has been proposed by the Canadian government.
   35

   ^35 For the purpose of simplification, only the working spouse's
   occupational earnings are taken into account. But it would also be
   possible to consider both the earned and the unearned income of the
   working spouse. This would have an impact on benefits as well as on
   obligations to pay.
   36

   ^36 The spouse who remains at home only half time and is employed
   during the other half of the time would be deemed to have an income
   corresponding to the addition of his or her earnings from outside work
   and 25 per cent of the other spouse's earnings.
   37

   ^37 This would also imply, of course, that the person at home would not
   be presumed to have 50 per cent of the spouse's earnings for purposes
   of social security entitlements, according to the principle that what
   one accepts as a beneficiary one should also accept as a payer.
   38

   ^38 It should be recalled that this value is only half of that of the
   total housework performed, since half of the housework is for the
   benefit of the spouse at home and should not be paid for by the working
   spouse.

   41

   ^41 If this approach were chosen, the couple in which both spouses work
   outside the home should be treated as having a total income of the
   household equal to their joint earnings, each paying taxes separately
   on half of that total. (Housework should not be considered in the case
   of such a couple, as is explained on p. 24.) This would retain the
   principle of income-splitting as it is applied in some countries for
   tax purposes, but without the fake distinction between ‘one-earner’ and
   ‘two-earner’ couples and without the present penalization of some
   married couples because the wife works outside the home.

   ^42 We have not considered, for example, the consequences of the new
   system proposed from the point of view of benefits accruing to possible
   beneficiaries other than the spouse; the methods of financing social
   benefits; or the types of social security systems involved.
   43

   ^43 In addition, the new system proposed seems more just for the
   working spouse than the recent measures or proposals (see footnote 34)
   which deprive him or her of part of the fruit of his or her own labour
   by requiring that half of his or her social security contri butions
   should be credited to the spouse at home.
   44

   ^44 For example, if the income enjoyed by the person at home is assumed
   to be half of the other spouse's earnings, any substitute income which
   would be guaranteed under the social security scheme would normally be
   only a portion of that income – probably equivalent to around 25 per
   cent of the spouse's earnings. Voluntary insurance could ensure that
   such a portion is supplemented in order to guarantee to the person at
   home a substitute income equal to half of any substitute income of the
   working spouse. If the person at home is assumed to have half of a
   total income of the household, equal to 150 per cent of the working
   spouse's earnings, each of them could have social security entitlements
   based on half of that total; the working spouse would have an
   entitlement based on less than 100 per cent of the fruit of his or her
   own labour.

How To Be A Good Housewife In The Modern Era

   Updated October 10, 2022 by ReGain Editorial Team

   The term housewife has come to have a negative connotation in the 21st
   century. The origin of housewife duty is actually a by-product of the
   Industrial Revolution when people moved out of agrarian societies and
   into modern cities and women faced new roles in society. With this new
   modern lifestyle, the definition of housewife came about: a woman who
   stays home and tends the children and house while her husband works in
   an industry-based job for forty or more hours a week. Whether they go
   by the name of housewife homemaker or stay-at-home mom, the housewife
   definition has certainly changed over the past century or so.

   Whether this is a result of less than accurate reality television, the
   prominence of feminism in current times, or some other idealization
   that being a housewife is no longer relevant, it is a job that has the
   opposite stigma than it did in the past. Women in the 1930s were
   expected to be housewives - the idea of women who work outside the home
   was frowned upon. They were expected to prioritize their home and
   family over everything else, especially a career. However, now that it
   is 2020, not only had the role of a housewife gone away nearly
   completely, but it has started to make a comeback.

   Ask A Board-Certified Marriage Counselor Online Today.

   While housewives or stay at home mothers are becoming common again, it
   is not the same situation as women who lived back in the early to
   mid-1900s. The differences between the two will shine some light on how
   to be a good housewife in the modern era. It will also allow you to set
   some expectations for yourself and your marriage, so that knowing who
   is supposed to be doing which tasks does not become a marital concern.
   Communicating these kinds of expectations in a marriage is the best way
   to avoid issues in your relationship early on.

Expectations Of A Housewife

   You might be wondering how different the duties of a modern era
   housewife might be from the role of housewife in the past. How much
   could the everyday tasks within the home change - cooking and cleaning,
   keeping the children entertained, and other domestic duties seem to be
   the basics no matter what year it is. If you have a social media
   presence, you might have seen how different those tasks can be when the
   excerpt from a 1950s home economics textbook made its rounds online.
   The domestic duties of a housewife and mother outlined in the textbook
   were enough to make most women roll their eyes. Whether they go by the
   name of housewife homemaker or stay-at-home mom, taking care of the
   house and children was always the number one priority.

   By understanding what it takes to be a modern house wife, you will get
   a grasp on some of what previous women experienced in the role.
   However, some of the traditional housewife tasks have changed with the
   times. Identifying those changes might help to make you a quality
   housewife in the 21st century. It will also help you to decide the kind
   of housewife you desire to be.

   Clean The House

   While the man is holding a full-time job outside of the house, the
   woman is holding a full-time job within the house. This means that a
   housewife is responsible for laundry, dusting, vacuuming, sweeping the
   floors, doing the dishes, not to mention cooking and cleaning up any
   clutter or toys left around the house. While it depends on the specific
   household, many housewives do some of these tasks daily (such as
   laundry) and others weekly (like dusting).

   A recent study shows that, on average, women spend 17 hours a
   week doing housework. This changes housewife housewife. A married woman
   with more than three children typically spends 28 hours a week
   accomplishing the same tasks. More kids mean more laundry, dishes, and
   messes in general, so a mother to several children will stay far busier
   as a stay at home mother and housewife. So, depending on housewares
   housewarming housewife, the work load and the time spent to take care
   of the house changes from home to home. With the baby boomer generation
   being born in the late 1940s to early 1960s, many households had more
   than three children. However, in the past, women spend more time on
   housework.

   It would be logical to think that modern technology has helped to cut
   down on those many hours of housework needed to tend house. The
   housewives of the past – traditional housewives – did not have robot
   vacuums, dishwashers, or high capacity washing machines. While the
   innovations used in the modern era have saved time and energy for
   homemakers, some things have not been made far simpler.

   Serving Meals

   Like past housewives, modern-day housewives are usually responsible for
   meals. Having homemade meals together is something that can really make
   a house a home. While there are some services available today that were
   not available years ago to a family and society, like meal subscription
   boxes, it is still up to the housewife to cook the food. How does this
   differ from housewives in the past? Meal planning in the 21st century
   has become a whole other entity. There were far fewer options in the
   past, and the cost of healthy food was far less, even considering the
   increase in wages and the cost of living overall.

   Because of the cost of healthy options, many housewives are forced to
   pick and choose between cost and quality. This might mean making one or
   two low costs, unhealthy meals for the week and a handful of pricier
   but healthier meals. With the planning involved in the modern era, most
   housewives spend far more time preparing for meals than they did in
   previous years.

   A good homemaker in the modern era will have the meals planned out
   before going grocery shopping. This way, she can control the grocery
   budget and be fully prepared to cook the meals throughout the week. By
   doing this, a housewife will also have the ability to estimate the time
   needed to prepare dinner, thus allowing her to create the most
   productive schedule. A schedule is a key aspect of maintaining the home
   and other domestic duties of being a housewife. After all, every good
   wife knows that preparing good food for her husband and family is a
   great way to show love!

   Taking Care Of The Kids

   No matter the era, a housewife is responsible for taking care of the
   children. While Dad is at work, a stay at home mother must care for her
   kids. Often, when men talk about what they want in a good wife, looking
   after the kids well is part of their criteria. This usually means
   ensuring that they are fed, bathed, teeth and hair have been brushed,
   they are dressed, and they have structured activities throughout the
   day. Although some housewives of the 21st century fall into the trap
   of plopping their children in front of the television, a good homemaker
   will organize a variety of activities and play dates with other
   children.

   When the children are school-aged, a housewife is typically responsible
   for making lunches and ensuring that they are prepared for school,
   extracurriculars, and taking them to and picking them up from school or
   their activities. A dictionary housewife also often requires that mom
   play the role of guidance counselor or therapist.

   Although housewives were responsible for keeping children away from Dad
   in the past so that he could relax after work, parenting in the modern
   era is much more of a team effort. Today's housewife communicates with
   her husband and does not do the parenting alone. Although her husband
   might be tired from a long day at work, a good full-time housewife will
   also be tired from a long day of caring for the house and kids.

   Spend One On One Time With Your Husband

   A big difference between previous housewives and today's housewives is
   the interaction that occurs between husband and wife. The 1950s home
   economics textbook that was previously mentioned instructs future
   housewives to allow their husbands to relax in the bedroom and let him
   have quiet time when he returns home from work. It also says that the
   wife should not pile her problems on him, as he should be able to
   unload his problems on you. While this was way back in 1950, being a
   housewife has changed dramatically in this area.

   Married couples in the modern era tend to do better with more
   communication between the two. Although a man should be able to talk to
   his wife about his problems and concerns, a wife should be able to do
   the same with her husband. By ensuring that communication between man
   and wife is open and honest, being a full-time housewife is a role that
   is more appreciated by both parties.

   When the focus is placed solely on one person in the relationship, the
   relationship can easily become one-sided. However, by being a housewife
   in the modern era, men are more enlightened in how much work their stay
   at home wives do.

   Being A Good Housewife In Today's World

   Times have changed. For a while, that meant being a housewife was
   uncommon. Those that were housewives were looked down upon.
   Fortunately, it is becoming a far better situation for mothers to stay
   at home with their children or wives to stay at home to keep up with
   the house. With the cost of daycare these days, it is the best option
   for many families. If you find yourself being a housewife in the modern
   era, following the above-mentioned suggestions will make you a good
   one!

   Remember, being a good housewife in this century means keeping the
   house clean, the kids fed and entertained, making well-rounded meals,
   and maintaining a relationship with your spouse. By placing proper
   emphasis on each of these categories, a fulltime housewife is sure to
   succeed in her journey in the home. If you feel as though reverting to
   the 1950 standards of a housewife would better work for you and your
   relationship, that is okay, too. Find a structure that works for you
   and stick with it!

   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

   Is Being A Housewife Easy?

   This will depend heavily on your situation. For example, being in a
   complicated financial situation might make being a housewife very
   stressful, or having a special needs child, or choosing to homeschool.
   There are many circumstances that could make your role as a stay at
   home mom/ wife more complex.

   Being an American housewife is full of tasks that can make the role a
   bit overwhelming. If you have children, the number of extracurricular
   activities American school possesses may pose some stress for a young
   housewife. Taking kids to school, home from school, to however many
   activities they have after school, and home from those activities can
   make time at home to do work more sparse or broken. That being said,
   when first adapting to the stay at home role, there will surely be a
   transition time before you get comfortable with the routine you have
   and the schedules your children have.

   Is Being A Housewife Good?

   There is absolutely no problem with being a housewife if that is what
   you want to do and it is financially feasible for you.

   The only problems would arise if you make major life decisions, such as
   staying home with your kids or leaving a job, based on external
   pressure rather than “following your heart” so to speak. Maybe you feel
   external pressure from a partner, a job, your friends, and societal
   expectations, but do not let them influence your decision to stay home
   or pursue a career. That is an intimately personal decision to make,
   and you should not need to apologize for it or explain it.

   But remember that feminism, and women’s rights, are centered around
   choice. That means that in an equal society, women have the right to
   choose the life they want, rather than having those decisions dictated
   for them by lawmakers, bosses, or other authority figures.

   Being a stay at home mom/wife is fulfilling an important role in the
   fabric of society. Contributing to a job or career with a skill that
   you excel in is an important role in the fabric of society. Just
   remember, that choice is yours, not anyone else’s.

   What Makes A Good Housewife?

   According to the English dictionary, a housewife is “a married woman in
   charge of a household.” This definition is open to a lot of
   interpretation regarding what is considered household matters.
   Nevertheless, this more modern English translation below will list a
   few different stay at home tasks that a good housewife might adhere
   to:
     * Cooking meals
     * Cleaning
     * Taking care of the pets/children (if any are had)
     * Transporting children to school and/or extra-curricular activities
     * Supporting her family/household members
     * Doing laundry
     * Educating your children and helping with homework or homeschool

   A more traditional image of a housewife may also include using a sewing
   kit to stitch up any worn and torn materials in the house. This image
   usually included a woman carrying around a small sewing kit in her
   dress pockets for those emergency sewing projects that just couldn’t
   wait. Additional tasks may be incorporated depending on your unique
   family and household.

   Beyond that, remember that taking care of yourself means a happier
   household for the whole family. For you, maybe being a good mother and
   wife means maintaining an exercise routine, investing in interior
   design, signing up for a boxing class, maintaining an active and
   fulfilling social life, or more. Before worrying about perfectly
   fulfilling the role of a good housewife, prioritize instead being the
   best version of yourself that you can be.

   What Is The Politically Correct Term For A Housewife?

   Stay at home mothers tends to be the preferred term for housewife. For
   similar reasons that are stated in “Is being a housewife good?” the
   term housewife itself tends to have a negative connotation for some
   people. Nevertheless, the term is not considered derogatory and can be
   used. Just be aware that some people may take offense to the diction.

   Who Is Happier, A Housewife Or Working Wife?

   According to a survey, the role of housewife is favored more than a
   career woman who must work outside the home. While many people may
   prefer to be stay at home mothers/wives, the reality is that being a
   housewife does not provide an income. That being said, a woman faced
   with financial pressures may need to give up the much-preferred role of
   being a stay at home mother/wife in order to provide for her family.

   Which Is Better, A Housewife Or Career Woman?

   Neither a housewife nor a career woman is particularly “better” than
   the other. The position depends entirely on how you would like your
   life to live your life and support your family. If you are happy
   staying at home and running your family/household, caring for your
   family, and raising your children, then being a housewife would be
   better for you. If you are an ambitious woman who wants to keep busy,
   make an income, and insert oneself into a career, then being a career
   woman may suit you best. It all depends on your individual
   circumstances and preferences.

   The only important thing is that you do not make decisions based on
   outside pressure. That might be outside pressure from a partner, a job,
   or even your girlfriends. If you want to be a housewife, be a
   housewife! If you want to be a career woman, go for it! Just never let
   anyone make you feel inferior for your decisions.

   Please read “Who is happier, a housewife or working wife?” for
   additional details to consider.

   What Can I Do As A Stay At Home Wife?

   Being a stay at home housewife (as stated in the English
   dictionary/English language definition of “housewife” in “What makes a
   good housewife?”) involves many tasks/chores to complete while home.
   These tasks may include the basics like cooking for the family,
   cleaning the house, gardening, maintaining the lawn, taking care of the
   children, supporting her husband, taking care of any pets,
   transportation of kiddos, etc.

   There are surely other tasks a stay at home mother/wife could do such
   as getting involved in their children’s school activities as a
   chaperone/supervisor, taking care of older parents who may live in or
   near the household, and/or joining community organizations. Please read
   “What makes a good housewife?” for more information.

   What Housewife Can Do At Home?

   A housewife can basically do whatever she needs to do to run a clean,
   smooth, functioning, and prosperous family and household. This may
   include (but are not limited to) a number of activities described in
   “What makes a good housewife?” and “What can I do as a stay at home
   wife?” Depending on the size and type of family you have, these tasks
   may vary slightly.

   If you chose to do so, you could be a part-time housewife who works
   part of the day and is home to run the house during the rest of the
   day. There is also the possibility of being home while working a job
   with flexible hours. This would allow some flow of income as well as
   the household to be maintained all from the comforts of the same
   location.

   Why Is Housewife Undervalued?

   Labor that is typically completed by women, especially in the home,
   tends to be undervalued and sometimes even unpaid.

   Housewives can be undervalued by spouses and society because of the
   past stereotypes into which women were forced. These stereotypes
   assumed that women could not and should not be involved in social,
   political, economic, etc. types of business because of their lack of
   knowledge and engagement in society. Now, housewives may still be
   undervalued because of their lack of income or adherence to historical
   stereotypes. A housewife could also be undervalued by her spouse
   because of the seemingly “trivial” work she must complete during the
   day in comparison to her husband’s work in society.

   Think about it this way: If you were not arranging the house, how much
   would your household have to spend on a cleaning service? If you were
   not raising your children, how much would you have to spend on
   childcare, tutors, chauffeurs, etc.? If you were not cooking, how much
   would a chef cost?

   The value of the things you do every day for your family would cost
   tens of thousands of dollars if you were not taking care of them.

   If anyone tries to belittle you for your role in your household, remind
   them that instead of one job, you juggle about ten different roles, and
   you do it all for free.

   How Do Housewives Keep Busy?

   Housewives keep busy through plenty of household tasks and schedules
   which must be maintained. These tasks involve the basic functions of a
   house: cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, taking care of and
   transporting children, outdoor work, taking care of fellow family
   members and pets if need be, etc. Further details can be found in “What
   makes a good housewife?” Additionally, a housewife must maintain
   multiple schedules other than her own.

   Generally, she must maintain her children’s schedules be them
   school-related, sports-related, and/or socially-related. A housewife
   must also maintain her husband’s schedule, ensuring that dinner is
   cooked upon his return home from work and even joining or bringing him
   lunch during his lunch hour. Though a housewife’s description does not
   technically involve these errands, a housewife and family woman may
   also need to take parents/relatives to doctor appointments or run with
   them for their own household errands if they need assistance.

   Is It OK To Be A Homemaker?

   It is definitely okay to be a homemaker if that position is financially
   and emotionally suitable for you. Ultimately, homemakers are always
   present in a family. The difference is found in the full-time and
   part-time roles these homemakers have. While some families may have
   full-time homemakers working constantly to maintain order in their
   house and family, others have multiple part-time homemakers (a mother
   and a father) working to keep order depending on their work schedules.
   That being said, whether you are full-time or part-time is completely
   acceptable as long as you are happy with your role choice.

   How Can I Be The Perfect Housewife?

   There is no standard for being the perfect housewife. At the end of the
   day, you will need to practice plenty in order to ensure everything
   that your household needs and complete that to the degree you believe
   is best. The modern English translation of being a housewife does not
   mean that you cannot be an active community member or figure in
   society. If you are able to run your house well and efficiently, then
   feel free to do more than just household tasks. For more information
   regarding at-home tasks, please read “What makes a good housewife?”

The stigma of a housewife

   The stigma of a housewife

   Read on to find out why this term is being seen as an insult and evokes
   negative emotions from today’s women
   Over the years, the divide between generations has only grown and that
   probably will explain why the older lot is at sea when the younger
   generation (especially married women) abhor the term ‘housewife’.
   Housewife v/s homemaker: While there is nothing wrong with the word per
   se, it’s what that term has come to represent; that women have a
   problem with says clinical psychologist Dr Seema Hingorrany. She says,
   “Our facets of personality are shaped by conditioning since childhood.
   It is called ‘learned behaviour’. One of the thought processes
   conditioned within us is that housewives don’t have their own identity
   and are always dependent on their spouses, financially and
   emotionally.”

   The housewife-serial connection A housewife is generally portrayed as a
   woman who is unsatisfied with her being or is watching soap operas all
   day. This concept is based on the premise that since a housewife does
   not go out of the house to earn an income, even if she has the
   qualifications to do so, then she must be indolent. This becomes even
   more glaring when she always has to ask her spouse for finances so she
   can run the house. Women don’t like to be called housewives because
   they feel it is a label of being inferior vis-a-vis women who are
   working.
   Why does one word evoke varied emotions like anger, disgust and pity?

   Clinical psychologist and psychotherapist, Varkha Chulani, claims it’s
   linguistics at play, and they are vital for our emotional well-being.
   She adds, “A person who is a housewife is ‘just’ that — a housewife.
   The meaning often attributed to that term is a person who doesn’t do
   much! A home-maker on the other hand is looked upon as person, who
   makes, creates, tends to, look after — the attribution to that term is
   one where the word is seen as more meaningful, more contributing. While
   in the former, the word doesn’t have the same connotation.” Ruchi
   Sinha, a working professional agrees, and adds, “While our grandmothers
   were proud of keeping a household together, today’s woman wants to be
   able to do much more than that. When I got married, I took a break from
   work for a while. And wherever I went I was asked about what I do. The
   term ‘housewife’ would get different reactions. While some would look
   at me with disdain others did probe further to find out if I was simply
   lazy or had no ambition in life. The term itself has now got a negative
   connotation and is often associated with women who don’t want to work
   and would rather live off their partners.”

   Seema adds, “My client Roma (name changed) refers to this as the
   housewife stigma because the term describes what a woman traditionally
   did within the four walls of her house. This includes cooking, cleaning
   and taking care of kids), which is not really valued by society. She
   feels that homemaker is a sophisticated word, and does imply that wives
   are not just sitting doing nothing but are fulfiling many domestic
   responsibilities. Most housewives are undervalued by their partners and
   by society at large. We forget that even though they are not being
   paid, the job they do cannot be quantified.”

‘Tradwives’: the new trend for submissive women has a dark heart and history

   A certain kind of housewife has found social media and is airing the
   details of their fight with feminism. But maybe they should tone it
   down a notch
   Who knew being traditional was so modern?

   What exciting trends are happening in the matrimonial sector?
   Kara, by email

   A thrilling new trend has emerged, and it’s as seismic as the New Look
   was in 40s fashion, or the emergence of Mediterranean cooking in 90s
   Britain: it’s called being a housewife.

   Now you might think: “Ummm, that doesn’t sound THAT new to me.” But all
   fashion trends are rehashes, and “tradwife”, as this one is dubbed, is
   housewife with a social media spin. It’s like bringing back 90s style,
   but swapping that brown eyeliner for contouring makeup. It’s just so
   much more zeitgeist, you see?

   So a “tradwife” is a woman who doesn’t work so as to look after their
   children, their husband, their home and then talk non-stop about how
   great this is on social media. Who knew being so traditional was also
   so modern? And so busy! Last week alone, there were interviews with
   tradwives in the Daily Mail, the Times and on the BBC, This Morning,
   Victoria Derbyshire and, for all I know, piped 24/7 across all
   channels. I’m afraid that – being both non-trad and a non-wife – I am
   less plugged in than these women.

   But I was especially taken with one trad wife. Her name is Alena Kate
   Pettitt, and in between showing TV crews how she lovingly irons her
   husband’s shirt and shops for onions, Pettitt runs something called the
   Darling Academy, which is a newsletter and YouTube channel that
   “celebrates British etiquette”. Initially, I assumed this meant
   reviving all that mad Nancy Mitford U and non-U stuff, and, let me tell
   you, as an American wannabe snob, I am VERY down with that. But no,
   Pettitt is “harnessing the best of what made Britain great, during that
   time when you could leave your front door open and know that you were
   safe, and you knew your strangers in the street.”

   Mmm, isn’t it funny how whenever people evoke a specific time when
   Britain was great, the time they invariably evoke is their own
   childhood before they were aware of the pressures and anxieties of
   adulthood? And I’ll be honest, every times Pettitt talks about her
   husband “taking care” of her, and that is pretty much her No 1 subject,
   she sounds more like she’s talking about her father than her husband.

   The tradwives have been keenly giving interviews about how they are the
   true feminists in choosing not to work, to which anyone with a modicum
   of knowledge about feminism would say: “We gave women the choice –
   that’s the point! Bake banana bread until the sun comes up, if it makes
   you happy!” Whether they are still the true feminists in suggesting
   that “husbands must always come first if you want a happy marriage”, as
   Pettitt has tweeted, feels more debatable. Also unacknowledged is that,
   as much as the tradwives think they are being renegade rebels by not
   working, their rebellion is based on their husband earning enough to
   support a whole household. Whoa there, little rebels!

   But this isn’t actually about fighting the system: this is about women
   fighting against their own insecurities about their lives. And because
   of these insecurities, they then insist they are the oppressed ones,
   the brave speakers of truth. In other words, it’s another pointless
   culture war to chuck on the teetering pile in between Spiked Online and
   Laurence Fox.

   And it’s also about something else. Rather awkwardly for the British
   tradwives – who like to suggest their movement is just about dressing
   in Cath Kidston and letting their husband choose where they are going
   on holiday – in the US and elsewhere it is very much part of the
   “alt-right” movement. It is especially popular among white
   supremacists, who are extremely down with the message that white women
   should submit to their husband and focus on making as many white babies
   as possible. British tradwives insist this has nothing to do with them:
   “Someone even said, this type of housewife was promoted by the Third
   Reich. And it’s like: ‘Really?! I didn’t even know that!’” Pettitt told
   the BBC, sitting underneath her union jack bunting, musing about how
   “we don’t even know the identity of our country right now”.

   Now look, clearly being a happy housewife does not mean you are a Nazi.
   But also, maybe it’s time to dial down a notch, tradwives, for your own
   sake? After all, if you’re constantly posting videos to YouTube about
   how to press your husband’s clothes, and talking to Phillip and Holly
   about how you love to flirt with your husband, how do you have time to
   do any tradwife-ing?

The educated housewife: A choice, not a chore

   The problem is not what women want and don’t want to do. The problem is
   that there is always someone who disapproves.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Mina Niaza October 21, 2016
   Until recently I’d felt that feminism, when it came to women working,
   was baseless because in most modern families, women can choose to
   either work or stay at home. But I’ve come to realise that the only
   reason I feel this way is because I’m lucky enough to have been raised
   in an environment where I am not expected to give up my dreams because
   of something as trivial as my gender.
   Let me tell you a story.
   I know someone who married at the age of twenty-six, of her own accord.
   She had already completed her Bachelor’s degree with a distinction, and
   continued to work even after getting married. Her daughter was born,
   and only four years later she established her own practice. This woman
   has served on the board of a prestigious university, has been published
   numerous times, and now, two decades later, is fulfilling another dream
   and completing her Master’s degree on full scholarship.
   I’d say that’s a pretty accurate image of a well-established female.
   The woman’s husband supported her every decision, never once asking her
   to give up her dreams and stay at home. You say,

     “She would’ve have never been around, her kids must have suffered”?

   And yet, both her children are happy, healthy, and currently completing
   their O and A Levels from one of the most prestigious schools in the
   country.

     “They must have no family life,” you think.

   Wrong again. The four of them form a closer knit family than most –
   they regularly go out to the cinema together, they eat breakfast and
   dinner together, and no weekend is complete without at least one family
   or friend gathering.
   When her children were born she took time off  (about a year and a
   half, both times) after which she worked only part-time and switched to
   a smaller nearby office so that she could reach home within five
   minutes if needed.
   Despite having this strong female figure in her life, her daughter is
   different. She dreams of getting married in her early twenties with a
   huge desi wedding. She wants to stay at with home with her children.
   Are you thinking it must be because her mother neglects her family and
   the daughter doesn’t want to make the same mistake? No, she has never
   felt neglected, nor has she ever resented her mother’s career, quite
   the opposite actually, she respects her career. Are you feminists
   shaking your head at her? Are you assuming that it’s the only life she
   can have because she’s an airhead and can’t be successful? No, she is
   not dumb. She is intelligent. She manages to maintain outstanding
   grades at one of the most sought-after schools in the country, is
   applying to the top universities in the world, and has set high
   academic goals for herself so that she can be independent. The only
   difference is that after all this is over, she will choose to stop
   working and become a stay-at-home mom. Not because she is pressured
   into it or because that’s what her husband would want, but because that
   is what she feels would make her happier and is what she’d want to do
   with her own life.
   Personally, I relate to the daughter, and those close to me know this.
   I was therefore left dumbfounded and hurt when they tsk’d and judged me
   for sharing a post about how girls should not be forced to stay
   confined to the kitchen.
   Just because I feel that girls should not be bound to work in kitchens
   all day, doesn’t mean I’m saying girls should not cook because it
   degrades them.
   It was then that I realised the extent of the situation. The majority
   of us have segregated to two poles. The first is the age-old “a girl
   should only cook, clean, and stay home.” The second pushes women to be
   solely career driven.
   There is a stereotype of house-wives and stay-at-home moms being
   regarded as signs of subservience and accepted inferiority. The problem
   is that girls are expected by some to stay home, but looked down upon
   by others if they comply. Do you see the pattern? There is no right
   answer, and the girl’s own voice is lost somewhere in between.
   A middle ground must be reached, where a woman can choose to either
   work or stay at home. To achieve this, there must be a shift in
   mind-sets of both extremes. Being career-oriented does not necessarily
   translate into being a terrible homemaker. Choosing to stay home to
   take care of the family does not give people the right to judge her for
   “accepting male superiority.”
   The problem is not what women want and don’t want to do. The problem is
   that whatever they do, there will always be someone who will
   disapprove.
   Feminists fight to empower women but sometimes fail to realise that
   women at home are empowered too. I am not a radical feminist, I am not
   a chauvinist. Yes, I want to stay at home. And no, I am not oppressed.

   Abid | 6 years ago | Reply In Islam men and women have equal rights. It
   is misrepresentation of Islam to say that men has more rights than
   women, instead in Islam the responsibility of men are more than women.
   Decision making is a responsibility not a right therefore the decision
   of husband should be followed by wife. The difference between rights
   and responsibility is that if someone does not avail his rights he will
   not be questioned rather will be awarded in hereafter on the other hand
   if someone does not perform his responsibility he will be questioned
   and will asked in hereafter.
   Xyz | 6 years ago | Reply A woman has and should choose her course of
   life however she needs to also understand the realities. There is a
   reason why financial independence is so important for every individual,
   be it a man or woman. Life is not a fairytale - divorces, deaths,
   abandonment, spousal abuse - these are real. And often women find
   themselves stranded vulnerable to exploitation.

   the comment above in which facts were taken at face value instead of
   being analysed and understood)

   men..Women were 100% correct who are angels and Gods greatest gift to
   earth??..You just proved your analysis and stating of facts is a lie
   and based on emotions..Farhan stands vindicated by his analysis of
   women
   farhan | 6 years ago Even people in the west are saying its due to
   feminism...Where are you living mars?...haha...Come one just told you
   facts and you interpreted them as you wanted to see. it dosent suit
   your interpretation of islam..Hypocrysy much..70% of women were
   oppressed so they took divorce..Its a factual statement as claimed by
   you...You analyze so good..70% divorce=70% oppressed women ..good
   logic..Just proves feminist think all men are bad,evil..
   Mina | 6 years ago | Reply Instead of blaming women for the increase in
   divorce rate, don't you think you should be a little smarter than that
   and think of why divorce rates increased? The rise in feminism simply
   made women realize that they should not be treated as if they were
   worthless or inferior to their husbands. So actually the rise in
   divorce rates just goes to show that 70% of women were living in
   abusive relationships, which in turn goes to show how messed up the
   mindset of most males is.
   Mina | 6 years ago | Reply Nowhere in any hadith does it specifically
   state that women cannot work. Bibi Khadija, the Prophet's first wife,
   was a businesswoman and the Prophet (pbuh) never asked her to stop
   working. Feelings are only being discussed because they are being hurt
   by uneducated people for unjustifiable reasons.
   farhan | 6 years ago and do you know that WHEN hazrat Khadija was alive
   the order of veil had not come..It was not revealed until she
   died..read sahih Bukhari and tafseer for further reference my
   sister..But i never said women are not allowed my sister..you just
   interpreted it wrongly..i just said you need husbands
   permission....This is islamic law and no one can change it
   Mina | 6 years ago | Reply The point is not that they should go out of
   their house even if their husband does not allow. The point is that the
   husband SHOULD allow.
   MR.X | 6 years ago upto the husband to decide....as per islamic law
   farhan | 6 years ago Its up to the husband to allow..not upto women
   ...This is clear from islamic law..you can consult anyone about this as
   it is clearly stated in Sahih Ahadith which i have personally
   read..Salam
   Fahim | 6 years ago | Reply Shy and feminine woman is ideal wife. Short
   tempered is not good, after marriage forgive your wife 70 times a day
   even any junior.
   MR.X | 6 years ago hmmm... i remeber the Prophets saying'treat women
   kindly, a women is liked a curved portion of a rib, if you try to
   starighten it, it will break'. This i read in Sahih Bukhari as i recall
   it..Sounds legit advice
   Fahim | 6 years ago | Reply Right but jokes apart it comes with a lot
   of benefits.
   MR.X | 6 years ago Fahim bhai, seeing these feminists these days, i
   want nothing to do with them, they are spoilt,narcisstic.. And i am
   short tempered and straight forward , i dont tolerate non-sense..Women
   actually feared me in university as per my friends..But then again they
   respected me and did not mess with me...i enjoyed it though...lol...i
   like shy and feminine women..
   Supriya Arcot | 6 years ago | Reply Women in applied professions like
   CA/Doc/Eng etc do injustice by wasting their education but if some one
   is bare basics like graduation (B.A , M.A ) etc., then yes the
   opportunity cost ( benefits otherwise ) are not much by 'sitting' at
   home.
   Mina | 6 years ago How can you say education is wasted? Education means
   attaining knowledge and everybody should have an equal right to
   knowledge regardless of what they may or may not choose to do with it.
   And if you mean in the sense that seats are wasted, then maybe people
   who DO want to work and not stay home should work harder and get better
   grades so that they can get those seats instead.
   Ravi Blr | 6 years ago | Reply To waste an education is criminal. All
   educated women should work, it benefits the woman, it benefits the
   family, and it benefits society and the country. Men cannot choose to
   sit at home after education, why do women feel they have a choice?
   Mina | 6 years ago Actually men do have a choice. They just don't
   exercise it because people will consider them slackers and shameless if
   they don't work. If their wife works instead then they can,
   essentially, stay home and look after the house and the children.
   Parvez | 6 years ago | Reply Nicely expressed....but you are talking of
   a very small percentage of people. In todays environment its the
   financial constraint that plays a big part in this decision. In many a
   family both parents HAVE to work in order to have a reasonable standard
   of living.
   ajay gupta | 6 years ago | Reply how can u be a pre medical student at
   grammar school? she aspires to go to med schl, is that what u mean?
   Hira Mirza | 6 years ago | Reply Since we are new to the concept of
   feminism and regard this only as a campaign adopted by the privileged
   class, it will probably take some time to strike a balance between the
   two extremes you have mentioned in your article. Nevertheless, we are
   learning to understand (sluggishly, yes) that every human being on this
   planet has his own mind and heart, so let's listen to what each says.
   MR.X | 6 years ago feminism is a failed concept..People in the west
   have seen its fruit..they themselves say that feminism caused high
   divorce rate..near 70 %.. In islam clearly husband has more right over
   his women ..or do you disagree with prophetic teachings which feminists
   indirectly lable as misogynst
   Razi Mallick | 6 years ago | Reply The article is juxtaposition of the
   girl’s inner feelings and till-formed opinions, which are still in the
   formative stage. But one thing seems evident, and that is her
   subconsciousness is reflecting dream of a family life galvanized with
   outpouring love and affection between husband and wife. Here I do not
   see any curse or rebellion against coercion but yearning for a serene
   family, living in an environment of cooperation and not confrontation.
   Imagine how a society would look like built on this foundation,
   especially in the prevailing environment where men and women have been
   pitted against each other. I would like to cite an example from the US
   2010 Census findings that twenty-four percent of the US children are
   living with single moms sliding down to further poverty, facing
   problems in transition from childhood to adulthood, and disconnected
   from the mainstream society. The innocent dream expressed by the girl
   gives me comforts and wish and pray for her dreams to be fulfilled
   Mina | 6 years ago Wow, thank you so much!
   Fahim | 6 years ago | Reply My wife had chosen herself to stay at home
   and YES I am OPPRESSED.
   MR.X | 6 years ago lol...so my fears about marriage are right??
   Shahzad Aslam | 6 years ago | Reply Very well written. A women should
   hear her own voice
   MR.X | 6 years ago | Reply yup, there are women who like to stay at
   home, like being provided for, this is their natural instincts and men
   are to provide for women as per islam ,,
   farhan | 6 years ago women are supposed to stay at home in islam..and
   cannot go out without their husbands permission according to Sahih
   Hadith

‘I want to submit to my husband like a 50s housewife’: inside the
controversial UK tradwife movement

   The tradwife movement is one of the most concerning trends to have
   emerged in the past few years, with more and more women looking to
   switch their careers and independence for tending to hearth and home –
   and every will of their husbands. But why? Stylist investigates.

   Jenny Smith* was 23 and working long days as a finance administrator
   when she read a book that changed her life.

   “Most of my friends wanted to have it all – career, partner, family –
   but I’d always secretly aspired to be a homemaker,” she says. “I loved
   gingham aprons and Doris Day, while women my age preferred the
   footballer’s wives look, all big hair and big handbags. I always felt
   out of step with the modern world.”

   The book was The Fascinating Girl, a 60s advice manual that counsels
   women that the ‘proper’ way to find a husband is to perfect their
   repertoire of domestic skills and be ‘childlike’ and ultra-feminine.

   “The chapter about how to make a man feel loved and valued by building
   a homely home really spoke to me,” Jenny says. “It validated my life
   goals.”
   [tradwive-movement-wives-2.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompres
   s]
   perfect family
   The tradwives movement is, remarkably, gaining thousands of followers
   in countries as diverse as the UK, Brazil, Germany and Japan.

   Today Jenny, 33, who is based in Doncaster* and a stepmother to two
   teens, aged 18 and 14, by her husband Dave*, is a proud #tradwife. She
   is part of a growing online and real-life movement that rejects the
   worldview of modern feminism and instead proposes that a woman’s route
   to happiness lies in pursuit of an ‘ideal’ femininity and domestic
   submission.

     “Women should aspire to an ideal femininity, manipulate men with
     their ‘feminine charms’ and see wifely subordination as the
     foundation of a happy marriage”

   Tradwifehood is, remarkably, gaining thousands of followers in
   countries as diverse as the UK, Brazil, Germany and Japan. The movement
   has star bloggers such as The Transformed Wife and The Vintage Mrs, who
   dish out advice on everything from baking cakes according to 50s
   recipes to ‘using girlishness to get your way’.

   Hashtags #tradwife, #tradfem and #vintagehousewife regularly trend on
   social media as would-be tradwives congregate in Facebook groups with
   names such as Women of Traditional Values and Make Traditional
   Housewives Great Again. Many tradwives are also vintage homecraft
   enthusiasts, rejecting technologies such as TVs and microwaves in
   favour of cooking from scratch and a modest lifestyle, or as they call
   it, the #tradlife.
   [tradwife-submit-to-husband.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompre
   ss]
   tradwife submit to husband
   Worryingly, aspiring tradwives can now sign up for Fascinating
   Womanhood classes in the UK.

   The #tradwife lodestar is Fascinating Womanhood. Written by Helen
   Andelin, an American Mormon mother of eight, the 1963 book argues that
   women should aspire to an ideal femininity, manipulate men with their
   ‘feminine charms’ and see wifely subordination as the foundation of a
   happy marriage. It quickly became known as ‘the book feminists love to
   hate’.

   In 1969, Andelin followed her femininity advice manual with a book
   addressed to single women, The Fascinating Girl, the book that led
   Jenny to traditional wifehood (and in 1972 her husband Aubrey published
   a book on ideal ‘masculine development’: Man of Steel and Velvet).

     “We say to feminists: thanks for the trousers, but we see life a
     different way”

   In a sign of the renewed interest in ‘trad’ femininity, Fascinating
   Womanhood, now a teaching business run by Andelin’s daughter Dixie
   Andelin Forsyth, has relaunched the movement’s 70s ‘femininity classes’
   as both real-world and online affairs. Over 100,000 women are signed up
   to these classes worldwide, including hundreds of women in the UK.
   Modules include feminine presentation (for example, instructions not to
   dress in scruffy ‘pizza eating clothes’ or in any way that could be
   considered lesbian) and how to behave in order to attract and keep a
   man (in short: puff up his ego, bat your eyelashes and don’t put out
   too quickly).

   “The movement’s rising because women have had enough of feminism in the
   UK and elsewhere,” Dixie Andelin Forsyth tells Stylist of the surprise
   resurgence of interest in her mother’s 60s book. “We say to feminists:
   thanks for the trousers, but we see life a different way.”

     “Fascinating Womanhood courses cover such topics as ‘ideal
     womanhood’, ‘femininity’, ‘childlikeness’ and ‘understanding,
     accepting, admiring and appreciating men’”

   The first accredited Fascinating Womanhood teacher in the UK, who calls
   herself Homekeeping Heart, launched her classes in 2018. The 10-session
   group classes, available online or in-person in the North of England,
   cover such topics as ‘ideal womanhood’, ‘femininity’, ‘childlikeness’
   and ‘understanding, accepting, admiring and appreciating men’. They
   cost £129, or £189 including three one-on-one sessions. There has been
   interest in the courses ‘from across the UK’.

   South London based Jade Lola*, 33, also felt at odds with the world
   until she discovered the #tradwife community. “My parents are Nigerian
   and quite leftwing,” she says. “But even as a teenager I was attracted
   to TV programmes like Little House on the Prairie and The Waltons, with
   their traditional mums and dads and loads of happy kids.”
   [traditional-wife-cooking-in-kitchen.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format
   %2Ccompress]
   traditional wife cooking in kitchen
   Why is the tradwife movement gaining popularity in the UK?

   Jade, who is single and works as an administrator in the City of
   London, came across the movement through the feeds of rightwing Youtube
   and Twitter stars in the US, such as Mormon blogger Ayla Stewart, aka
   Wife With A Purpose. She immediately felt at home.

   It was through one of Stewart’s posts that Jade heard about the 1963
   Fascinating Womanhood book. She bought a copy online and liked its
   advice about how women should be demure and make men feel like real
   men. “I changed my style to be more feminine, dropped my habit of
   wearing trousers and started to cover up my cleavage,” Jade recalls,
   adding that she now aspires to find a ‘trad’ man who’ll support her
   while she stays at home. It’s not an easy feat, she admits, when you’re
   app dating in the UK. “Men can be scared off when you tell them that
   you want to be a traditional housewife.” Jade now hopes to use online
   dating to meet a man in the US, where the #tradlife movement is more
   established.

     “It’s easy to think that a retreat to grandma’s apron is the cure
     for all our problems”

   The question, of course, is why? Why, a full 40 years since Second Wave
   feminists called out the myth that domestic subordination was the only
   means to women’s fulfillment, are so many British women attracted to
   these narratives?

   In her 1989 book Backlash, feminist author Susan Faludi documents the
   antifeminist ‘feminity movements’ that have followed each wave of
   feminism, from the suffragettes to the Second Wave. “The backlash
   remarkets old myths about women as new facts and ignores all appeals to
   reason,” Faludi concludes.

   Social psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley, meanwhile, believes today’s
   tradwife trend speaks to our socially turbulent times. “We only
   remember the good bits of the past, such as the warm kitchens and
   cuddles from grandma,” she explains. “It’s an easy step from this to
   think that a retreat to grandma’s apron is the cure for all our
   problems.”
   [tradwife-happy-marriage.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress]

   Tradwives: “I love cooking for my husband and young daughter, and
   tending hearth and home"

   For Leeds-based tradwife Christine Warren*, 28, the attraction of the
   tradwifehood is precisely this cosy imagined past. “I love cooking for
   my husband and young daughter, and tending hearth and home. And my
   husband loves being taken care of. It just feels that that traditional
   gender roles are the right way to live.”

   Christine got into the movement through the 40s vintage scene, picking
   up tea dresses and skirt suits at vintage stores and finding
   communities of fellow enthusiasts in online groups such as The
   Authentic 1940s Fashion Forum. “I realised I liked the morals of the
   era too,” Christine explains. “The idea that you should marry before
   having children, have one marriage and make that marriage work.”

     “Tradwife Facebook groups bristle with posts about women who’ve
     given up work to ‘spoil’ their husbands ‘like 50s housewives’”

   Christine is not alone in finding that an obsession with vintage
   fashion was a stepping stone to socially conservative attitudes towards
   gender roles. Tradwife Facebook groups bristle with posts about women
   who’ve given up work to ‘spoil’ their husbands ‘like 50s housewives’
   (“Oooh I would give up work to spoil my hub IN A HEARTBEAT,” reads a
   typical response on the forum Being A Vintage Housewife).

   Some 40s housewife enthusiasts take the lifestyle a step further and
   live the #HomeFront life, cooking from World War II rationing recipes
   and even retrofitting their homes to the 40s and 50s, ripping out
   central heating and installing outside loos. Fascinating Womanhood’s
   femininity classes capitalise on this retro mystique, detailing three
   ‘ideal’ fashion looks: dramatic (exemplified by Elizabeth Taylor);
   classic (Jackie O; Audrey Hepburn); and romantic (the ruffles and bows
   of an early 80s Princess Diana).
   [housewife.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress]

   Tradwives: “For me the movement is about feminine self-improvement.”

   Central to #tradwifehood’s message is the notion that feminism, with
   its questioning of the ‘traditional’ sexed roles, has gone too far.
   “Tell men not to be men and women not to be women and you get family
   breakdown,” says Jade of this way of thinking. Tradwives are often wary
   of talking about their beliefs on social media for fear of being
   trolled by what they perceive as an enemy feminist majority (it’s for
   this reason that we agreed to conceal interviewees’ surnames for this
   story). “People who want to live a traditional lifestyle get a load of
   abuse,” Christine explains. “People just don’t get us, I guess”.

   Like many #tradwives, Jade lives a double identity, keeping her real
   beliefs about men, women and marriage for sympathetic tradwife friends
   and forums. For several years she posted to a YouTube channel, but took
   it down after receiving ‘a lot of flack’ about her attitudes to men,
   women and marriage. “I don’t really have an issue with feminists,
   although I do have a problem with anyone who doesn’t respect my
   choices,” Jade explains. “They say feminism is about choice, but I
   don’t always see that.”

     “Is this a harmless social media trend, up there with Rickrolling
     and grumpy cats, or a sinister shortcut to Gilead?”

   Jenny, who says that friends and family see her as “quaint and
   grandmotherly”, feels that the traditional womanhood movement is
   broadly misunderstood. “People take a passage from Fascinating
   Womanhood out of context, or they think we want women to be powerless
   and downtrodden,” she says. “For me the movement is about feminine
   self-improvement.”

   Whether you think its brand of pre-feminist nostalgia is a harmless
   social media trend, up there with Rickrolling and grumpy cats, or a
   sinister shortcut to Gilead, the #tradwife #tradlife is here to stay.
   Fascinating Womanhood plans ‘a big push’ into Europe, East Asia and
   Russia in the coming year and Dixie Andelin’s follow-up book to the
   1963 original, Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman, which adds
   chapters on step parenthood and working women, recently made it onto
   Amazon’s worldwide digital bestseller list.

     “I simply think the old ways were better: when men provided and
     protected and women took care of their men”

   Every week sees the arrival of a new tradwife forum online, full of
   posts about ‘finding joy’ in household chores. The rise of
   ultra-feminine social media ‘cleanflunecers’ such as Mrs Hinch and The
   Organised Mum can also be seen as part of the same trad backlash.

   “When I tell modern women that my ambition is to be a trad wife they
   say; ‘why would you do that when women have fought for years to get out
   of the kitchen’?” Jade muses. “I simply think the old ways were better:
   when men provided and protected and women took care of their men. I
   just ask not to be judged.”

   5 practical ideas to implement SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and
   empower women and girls by starting with your own wife.

   Some men pronounce themselves publicly in favor of women’s rights and
   gender equality. They might even call themselves feminists or fight in
   organisations, devoted to the implementation of the SDGs.

   In theory, it sure does sound good to be a supporter of women. However,
   when looking at their own homes, they might not always treat their wife
   and partner with the respect they deserve.

   In this article, we would like to draw a closer look to implementing
   gender equality at home in your relationship.

   What does it mean to have a marriage that is based on the principle of
   gender equality? Which strategies and values will help a couple to live
   the gender equality demanded by SDG5?

   (And by the way, for the men among you who like being the “boss” of the
   family: You have no idea what you are actually missing in your
   relationship :-)).

   Our five practical suggestions should give you the possibility to
   critically reflect on subconscious behaviours in your couple.

   Number 1: Let’s talk about money!

   Who earns more money in your relationship? Even the most
   forward-thinking men don’t like to admit that their wives earn more
   money. But why is that? Is it difficult for men to be proud when their
   wives are professionally successful? Doesn’t that mean that they have
   made a good choice by marrying an intelligent partner?

   Money can often be intimidating. Then there are questions of joint bank
   accounts, credit cards and so on. Whatever you decide, just make sure
   that you discuss it first. Be honest about your feelings.

   If your partner’s money intimidates you, just say so. If you feel like
   earning more money or changing your career path, this is more than
   legitimate. When planning bigger investments, make the decisions
   together.

   If you want to be financially independent, that’s also fine. Just keep
   in mind: Your relationship shouldn’t be about money. Money doesn’t
   define you or your ability. Equality in a relationship means that both
   partners can earn money, but it doesn’t matter who earns more of it.

   Number 2: Let’s talk about sex!

   Let’s not deny it: Good sex is an important part of a good
   relationship. But who defines what good sex is?

   In a relationship based on equality partners not only have sex, but
   they also talk about it. Sometimes the talking part can even be more
   intimate than the actual sex.

   Sex should be about discovering your partner’s body and your partner’s
   wishes and desires. An orgasm is not a one-way-street, nor is it the
   ultimate goal of every intercourse. Much more than that, sexuality is a
   way of getting closer together, to create an intimate space for the two
   of you.

   Equality in sexuality means that nobody is left behind. It also means
   that both partners can refuse intercourse whenever they don’t feel like
   it. And it signifies that the pleasure of both partners is equally
   important.

   So, go ahead and talk about it. And it includes menstruation and surely
   contraception, which is a matter for both partners.

   Number 3: Let’s talk about kids!

   Whenever kids come to play in a relationship, things become more
   complex. A new role distribution has to take place. Although it should
   be normal that mothers and fathers take over the same responsibilities
   in the 21^st century, many families seem to be back to the stone age
   after the birth of a child.

   Why can’t both, Mum and Dad, wash the baby, change nappies, feed their
   child, wake up at night and so forth? If a mother is still
   breastfeeding, that doesn’t mean that the Dad cannot take other
   responsibilities to make up for it: take the child for a walk, bring
   his partner some water to drink while breastfeeding or prepare dinner.

   Caring for a child is a lot of work. It is equally rewarding to see how
   close relationships mostly grow between children with a Dad who is
   present to do all the things that were just enumerated.

   Dads who are away most of the time, miss out on a lot of great things.
   Of course, it is okay to return to work after childbirth. However, this
   right should apply to mothers and fathers equally.

   Women often sacrifice their careers or are condemned to a life-lasting
   part-time job that doesn’t fulfill them. The most important thing is to
   discuss where you want to go with your life and who takes which
   responsibilities.

   Number 4: Let’s talk about support!

   Being in a relationship based on equality doesn’t mean that you have to
   want the same things all the time. However, the key word here is:
   support!

   Your partner wants to open a creative online-shop – just go for it! You
   can express your opinion about it by being supportive at the same time.
   Be happy for your partner’s success and accompany him or her to achieve
   his or her goals.

   Number 5: Let’s talk about us!

   The key to any successful relationship, based on gender equality
   supported by mutual respect, is communication. Communication sometimes
   means the ability to put behind your personal anger and your needs and
   to express your thoughts with words.

   Whenever something is bothering you, you should bring it to the
   attention of your partner in a respectful way. A regular sit-together
   can help you discuss important aspects of your relationship and of your
   life as a couple.

Why "Housewife" Should Not Be A Dirty Word

   As the daughter of a full-time mom, the word “housewife” elicits mixed
   feelings. On the one hand, as a Latina feminist, I am aware of how our
   patriarchal society governs women's roles and relegates them to
   traditional domesticity. On the other, though, I have watched my mother
   endure burns, scratches and arthritic pain to do the back-breaking work
   that supports her household — and can't help but admire and appreciate
   her work ethic. I was offended and even a bit hurt, therefore, to learn
   that Dictionary.com defines "housewife" as a term that is “sometimes
   offensive."

   To be fair, this designation perhaps makes sense based on the
   relatively recent historical legacy established by the feminist
   movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Being a housewife was largely regarded
   by this movement as equitable to giving up one's power and, in a sense,
   being coerced into doing domestic work. Feminist leaders — like Betty
   Friedan, author of the famous book, The Feminist Mystique — perpetuated
   this idea and proposed that women must reject domesticity by breaking
   professional barriers and claiming personal, sexual freedom. Rejecting
   the "housewife" role was part and parcel of this effort.

   The current, negative connotation of the term "housewife," therefore,
   is likely tied to this perception that domestic work was inherently
   oppressive. It's true that for decades many women had no choice but to
   be housewives and it makes sense that being perpetually confined to one
   role would make anyone hate any occupation, no matter it's nature.
   What's more, many women at the time likely did hate being housewives
   and wanted something else from life.

   But the idea that being a housewife is somehow less worthy of respect
   has carried on to our generation, despite the fact that many women do
   have other options now. Maintaining this belief therefore fails to take
   into account (and actively discredits) the women who genuinely enjoy
   housework. It also devalues all the work that does go into being a
   "housewife." According to a 2014 survey by Salary.com, for example, the
   average stay-at-home mom would have made $188,905 in 2014 including
   56.5 hours in overtime. Working moms, according to the same survey,
   would have made $70,107, excluding the money they earn from their jobs
   outside the home.

   Clearly, being a housewife is not an easy job and deserves respect. Now
   that women have many opportunities available to them, being a housewife
   is often a choice rather than a role necessitated by coercion or a lack
   of other opportunities. An interest in domesticity shouldn't make a
   woman any less feminist or necessarily less independent than those who
   work predominately outside of the home.

   While some might say we should retire the stigmatized term, doing so
   would mean that there was something wrong with it in the first place.
   Modern feminism prides itself on respecting women’s choices, regardless
   of how much we disagree with them, and retiring the term would rob many
   women of being able to make the choice that is best for them and their
   families. Instead, women who choose this path should reclaim it — and
   we should all respect them for doing so.

What kind of woman are you: A housewife or a career woman?

Why do women leave their children and go to work? Some women decide to work
for financial reasons, some to escape from home, some to relieve their
stress, etc.

   What kind of woman are you: A housewife or a career woman?
   Follow Saudigazette on Google News Account




   Why do women leave their children and go to work? Some women decide to
   work for financial reasons, some to escape from home, some to relieve
   their stress, etc.

   However, some of those in the older generation believe that women
   should not work and that they should instead be homemakers. Yet a few
   do believe that women should work so that the family can benefit in
   many ways. To begin with, having a working mother in the family will
   help the family financially. A working woman has her own career
   aspirations and her own set of responsibilities. But for a housewife,
   life starts and ends with her husband, children and her own family

   There are both advantages and disadvantages to being a working woman
   just as there are to being a housewife. Working women have to leave
   their children in the care of a housemaid or someone else. However, you
   cannot trust housemaids, as they cannot give the care which only a
   mother can give.

   I asked a few women about how they feel about being a housewife or a
   working woman in Saudi Arabia. Their opinions are as follows:

   Ayesha, an Indian housewife, said: “I am an educated housewife. After
   returning from school, my  children are very happy when they find me at
   home. They have so much to talk about.  A housewife can help her
   children with their homework, and who says that housewives are not
   contributing to the family financially? They save the cost of a
   housemaid and of private tuition as well. This is a major contribution.
   Moreover, the joy on my child’s face is enough of a reward for me!”

   Fatima Khan, a Pakistani, said: “As a working woman, I know how painful
   it is to leave your children at home and go to work. I sometimes wish I
   could stay home but that is not possible because I want to give my
   child a better life and a better education. Housewives also contribute
   a lot to their family. It’s not an easy task to sacrifice your career
   and stay home to cook and look after your children. I feel that working
   at home is more difficult than working in an office.”

   Anna, who is from the Philippines, said: “I am a graduate and I was
   working before my marriage. After I moved to Saudi Arabia, I realized
   how good it would be to know that for someone, you are everything. When
   you come back from the office, you get the proper attention and care
   that you aspire to. Your children are given proper personal care and
   attention, which is very important as it makes the bond between parents
   and children stronger. My children are teenagers and I must spend time
   with them in order to make them feel secure and to keep them away from
   negative thoughts.”


   A Saudi woman said: “Men have been given the Islamic responsibility of
   providing for women, who are by default financially dependent on
   father, husband or brother. In earlier days, women enjoyed the luxury
   of being at home, cooking, watching TV, reading newspapers and doing
   housework. Now women wish to work and earn for themselves. However,
   they should try to maintain a balance between work and family.

   “If a woman fears God, she will not allow her work to affect her
   Islamic obligations, such as offering the daily five prayers on time,
   fasting during Ramadan, gaining Islamic knowledge, reciting the Holy
   Qur’an and wearing the hijab. So in my opinion, a women can work but
   her family and responsibility should be of prime importance.”

   Heena Syed, a Sri Lankan, said: “In today’s world, the salary of both
   the husband and the wife are required in order to have a good home, a
   good car and a good bank balance for the children’s future. The work of
   both parents is essential for the progress of the family. Being with
   her husband and children 24 hours a day does not mean that a woman is
   the perfect mother.  A working woman understands the value of work.
   Unlike a housewife, she never blames her husband for being late from
   the office. Working women often find some fulfillment in their jobs,
   apart from home. Hence, they may have better life satisfaction and feel
   less dependent on their husbands. This in turn can lead to more harmony
   in the family.”

   Sana Obaid, a Saudi, said: “I work as a teacher and I feel that my kids
   are financially secure. They can join extra coaching programs and
   enroll in activities as per their wish. I spend my weekends fully with
   my kids and husband so I personally feel that being a working women
   does not affect my family.”

   Jabida, an Indian, said: “I want to say that I disagree with the idea
   that housewives are less educated. I have worked when I needed to.
   Right now I can stay at home and I love it. I teach my daughter the
   alphabet, numbers, colors, shapes, etc. We go outside and do various
   activities, such as cooking, cleaning and the list goes on. I also help
   my husband by working on a few computer programs. In this way I am
   content.”

   Mohamed Hasan, an Indian student, said: “I feel the choice should be
   given to the lady.  If she wishes to work, if she is confident that she
   can handle both working and her family obligations and if her spouse
   and family are willing to support her, then she can have a career.  It
   does lead to fulfillment.  And with changing times, a lady can also
   work from home, part time, or with flexible hours.  So let her choose
   whether she wants to have a career or wants to be a housewife.”

   So to conclude, I would like to share the example of Hazrat Khadija
   (may Allah be pleased with her) who was the wife of our beloved Prophet
   (peace be upon him). She was one of the most successful businesswomen
   of her times and she conducted transactions through her husband,
   Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).

   A woman in Islam is given financial security. Many women still tend to
   be housewives in Saudi Arabia, while others want to work for their own
   reasons. I think both of these choices are acceptable. It depends on
   your own attitude toward life.

   Shafeeka Basheer,
   Dammam

Why Is Housewife a Bad Word?

   And why do we need to use it?
   Photo by JESHOOTS.COM on Unsplash

   I know I’m walking a dangerous path with his article and risk being
   hung for even daring to talk about the word housewife, but I’m a
   reader, and when I read things, they make me think, and this is one of
   those moments.

   And yes, yes, I probably shouldn’t think, but here goes. I get myself
   ready for the flames.

Infinities of being a housewife

Why her ‘job’ is perhaps the most magnanimous one in the world

   When my cousin sister was seven years old, my father, at a family
   gathering, put her on his lap and asked her, “So little girl, what do
   you want to be when you grow up?” She put on a pensive face as she
   mulled over the question. Finally, her eyes brightened as she pointed a
   finger at her mother and squealed, “A housewife!”

   For a moment, every soul listening to that seemingly innocuous exchange
   was stunned into silence, which was broken only by the guttural
   laughter of my aunt’s father-in-law, my cousin’s paternal grandfather.
   “Sweet child! That’s not a profession. The job of a housewife is hardly
   a job. It’s a duty.”

   We live in the 21st century. As a country we proudly highlight our
   progress by citing the existence of a burgeoning female workforce, one
   that includes highly educated and skilled professionals. Yet, we cannot
   deny the fact that a majority of Indian women still do not go out to
   work. Instead, they work at home. Not from home as entrepreneurs or
   freelancers, but rather in their houses, as housewives.

   At the core of every family, nuclear or joint, is the housewife. The
   importance of her physical presence is underscored by the stasis the
   household comes to when she is not around. She single-handedly runs it,
   juggling chores such as cooking, washing, cleaning and caretaking with
   great skill.

   Emotionally, she holds the family together. She is a pillar of support
   for her husband, a guiding light for her child, and a harbour for the
   family’s elderly. It’s as though her existence is entirely selfless,
   always putting the interests of others over and above her own.

   There is hardly any difference between the ‘job’ description of a
   housewife and that of the chief executive officer of a company. While
   the CEO steers a company forward, the housewife is at the helm of the
   household. The CEO may work 12 hours a day, taking important decisions
   in the field of production, sales, finance and human resources. The
   housewife is just as able an administrator. She, in fact, works
   round-the-clock. She also deals with physical, financial and human
   resources. Her decisions affect the lives of people and the well-being
   of the home. However, the work she does is not quite considered a
   ‘job’. A CEO gets paid in millions, while her work just goes
   unacknowledged. She rarely even receives gratitude; remuneration, then,
   seems like a ridiculous idea.

   The patriarchal understanding of the role of a housewife is that her
   job is a duty. She has to perform these tasks on a daily basis,
   irrespective of whether she likes it or wants to do it at all. Her job
   is thankless. But then again, her job is not a job. Her skills are not
   marketable; she is not the breadwinner of the house. In its blunt
   interpretation of this metaphor, our male chauvinistic society has
   failed to realise that while the man may bring home the bread, it is
   the woman, or the housewife, who actually makes the food that he eats
   out of that bread.

   A housewife wants nothing more than to be treated with love, respect,
   gratefulness and dignity. Her ‘job’ is perhaps the most magnanimous one
   in the world. It’s time society woke up to her domestic significance,
   instead of taking her for granted. She deserves her due and it’s up to
   us to change regressive mindsets, celebrate her place in the familial
   ecosystem and recognise her noble, yet silent toil.

   COMMENTARY
   Politicizing the Housewife
   November 1, 2001
   By Wendy McElroy

   What it means to be a housewife is being revised ideologically in order
   to impugn the choice some mothers make to stay at home.

   The revisionism has been fueled by the recent case of Andrea Yates, the
   Texas mother who drowned her five young children in a bathtub. The
   murders were allegedly committed because Yates suffered from postpartum
   depression aggravated by being a stay-at-home mom.

   Cheryl L. Meyer, coauthor of the forthcoming book Mothers Who Kill
   Their Children and an associate professor of psychology at Wright State
   University, expressed a new feminist line on stay-at-home moms in an
   article at Womens Enews (June 27), a popular feminist Web site. Meyer
   wrote, The reality is that the mother who kills her child is every
   mother, any mother. In positing Yates as an Every Woman, Meyer
   continues, Most mothers just seem to understand how a woman could kill
   her child. When we target certain cases and try to ascertain how this
   particular mother could have killed her child, we mask the more
   important question, why dont more mothers do this?

   Marcia Wilkie, coauthor of Marie Osmonds autobiographical account of
   postpartum depression, intimately linked Americas sweetheart to the
   murderous Yates in a Newsweek article (July 2). In a column in the same
   issue, Playing God on No Sleep, the Pulitzerprize-winning Anna
   Quindlen argued that every mother secretly identified with killing her
   own children. She described the typical stay-at-home housewife this
   way: Shes tired, shes hot and shes been up all night throwing
   sheets into the washer because the smaller of her two boys has
   projectile vomiting so severe it looks like a special effect from The
   Exorcist. Oh, and shes nauseated, too, because since she already has
   two kids under the age of 5 it made perfect sense to have another, and
   shes four months pregnant. With housework added to the unsavory mix,
   this Every Woman lives on the verge of snapping and committing
   infanticide.

   A myth created by PC feminism is dying and a new one is being created
   to replace it. The dying myth is that women do not commit acts of
   domestic violence: men do.

   It has been well documented that wives assault husbands at
   approximately the same rate as husbands assault wives. The statistics
   regarding fatal child abuse are even more alarming. A Bureau of Justice
   report titled Murder in Families (NCJ 143498) surveyed murder cases
   tried in 1988 and discovered that 55 percent of defendants charged with
   killing their own children were women. The Third National Incidence
   Study of Child Abuse and Neglect (NIS-3, 1996) from the Department of
   Health and Human Services reported that mothers perpetrate 78 percent
   of fatal child abuse. Even granting that women are usually the primary
   caregivers and thus have much more opportunity and motive to snap,
   these figures are alarmingly high. They are so high and the subject of
   so much attention that it is no longer credible to claim that women are
   nonviolent in the home.

   To preserve the image of women as victims of oppressive male society,
   however, PC feminists find it necessary to explain how the murder of a
   child by his or her mother is still the fault of men. The first step is
   to remove responsibility from the mother by blaming her acts on
   postpartum depression or some other insanity with which most women
   can identify. The second step is to castigate the traditional family
   with its stay-at-home mom as a breeding ground of pathology for women.
   Since PC feminists already decry the traditional family as a bastion of
   white male culture and a barrier to womens actualizing their
   potential, the next leap of logic is easy. Murdering moms are driven to
   violence by the men who impregnate them and trap them in the
   psychologically devastating role of housewife. Thus many voices in the
   media blame Andrea Yatess husbanda man whom no one has suggested was
   ever violenteven while they express sympathy for Andrea herself. They
   blame society for not recognizing Andreas plight.

Friedan Called into Question

   Interestingly, the current debate about housewifery comes at the same
   time as the validity of the book that sparked the original debate is
   being severely questioned. In 1963 Betty Friedans book The Feminine
   Mystique, spoke of the problem that has no name. Stated simply,
   domesticity denied housewives their humanity and potential, making them
   suffer both physically and mentally. Friedan described the typical 50s
   family as a comfortable concentration camp. Like camp inmates,
   suburban housewives had adjusted psychologically and become dependent,
   passive, childlike and lived at a lower human level.

   Selling millions of copies, The Feminine Mystique became a powerful
   force in shaping American culture and has been credited with inspiring
   Second Wave feminism. Certainly it led to Friedans co-founding of the
   National Organization for Women (1966). The book has taken its rightful
   place as an icon of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 70s
   during which women flooded out of the home into the university and the
   workplace. As women continued to read Friedans book, the idea of
   housewifery as a pathology was cemented to feminism.

   Recent works have thoroughly discredited Friedans arguments, the power
   of which was derived from claims of personal experience and the
   authorities she cited to support her claims. In his book Betty Friedan
   and the Making of the Feminine Mystique (1998), Daniel Horowitz
   explored Friedans background and debunked the myth that she ever
   represented the typical suburban housewife as she has persistently
   claimed. Friedan had been a staunch political activist on the communist
   left for decades before her first book appeared. Horowitzs analysis is
   all the more damning because as a leftist he is sympathetic to her
   politics. He argues that she hid her past because she was afraid of
   being persecuted during the McCarthy witch hunts. Whatever Friedans
   motives may have been, they make The Feminine Mystique appear
   disingenuous.

   In a 1973 article in the New York Times Magazine titled Up From the
   Kitchen Floor, Friedan claimed that when she wrote her book in the
   early 60s, I wasnt even conscious of the woman problem. Yet in 1951
   Betty Goldstein (Friedans maiden name) wrote an article titled UE
   [the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America] Drive on
   Wage, Job Discrimination Wins Cheers from Women Members (UE News,
   April 16) in which she reported on a labor meeting. Goldstein described
   the women as fighters who refuse any longer to be paid or treated as
   some inferior species by their bosses, or by any male workers who have
   swallowed the bosses thinking.

   The fact that readers of Friedans book identified with her as a
   sister-housewife who had naïvely bought into the domesticity myth was
   one reason for The Feminine Mystiques huge success. The same
   readership would never have identified with the real Friedan: a
   left-wing labor journalist; a member of Marxist discussion groups;
   author of the union pamphlet UE Fights for Women Workers (June 1952),
   which critiqued wage discrimination based on sex; a rent striker; and a
   career woman who hired a really good mother-substitutea
   housekeeper-nurse (Charm, April 1955).

   In an article titled Rethinking Betty Friedan and The Feminine
   Mystiquee: Labor Union Radicalism and Feminism in Cold War America
   (American Quarterly, March 1996), Horowitz argued that an examination
   of Friedans communist past and her subsequent shift toward
   respectability illustrates a significant turn within the ideology of
   the left in the 1950s. It is a microcosm of how the Old Left has
   evolved into the politically correct New Left. The ideology expanded
   from economic analysis, which was based on Marxism, to include
   humanistic psychology and a focus on the effect of consumption on
   the middle class. In his analysis, contemporary feminism is merely a
   subset of the New Left.

   In addition to questions about Friedans credentials as a housewife,
   grave doubt has been cast both on her interpretation of the experts on
   which The Feminine Mystique was based and the facts presented by the
   experts themselves. In the Atlantic Monthly (September 1999), Alan
   Wolfe, director of the Center for Religion and American Public Life at
   Boston College, raised the question of whether a book can arrive at
   the larger truths if the bricks on which it is built wont stand up to
   time.

   This question is particularly relevant to The Feminine Mystique, which
   relies heavily on appeals to authority, from psychologists such as
   Freud and Abraham Maslow to the anthropologist Margaret Mead and the
   sex researcher Alfred Kinsey.

   In using these experts, Friedan dips in and out of their work, citing
   the evidence that supports her position and ignoring whatever
   contradicts it. Even the supporting evidence no longer provides a real
   prop. In the years following publication of Friedans book, much of the
   selectively cited research has been discredited. For example, Derek
   Freemans book The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead: A Historical
   Analysis of Her Samoan Research (1999) effectively countered the claims
   made in Meads work Coming of Age in Samoaa book highly touted in The
   Feminine Mystique. The credibility of Kinsey has fared even worse as
   rampant bias in his methodology has been revealed.

   Wolfe concludes, To make her case that women required freedom, Friedan
   felt it necessary to exaggerate the degree to which they lived in
   slavery. Unfortunately for her argument, the treatment of a serious
   social problem which relies on the authority of experts appears far
   less persuasive if the experts turn out to be telling just-so stories.
   Without the backing of solid statistics and research, Friedans work
   does nothing more than offer anecdotal evidence of the unhappiness of
   some housewives and then proceeds to define the reality of most on that
   basis.

   Friedans credibility has fallen on hard times. Even the admiring
   biographer Judith Hennessee is strangely critical of her subject in the
   book Betty Friedan: Her Life (1999). In the introduction she admits
   being disappointed in Friedan the person as opposed to Friedan the
   thinker. Hennessee speaks of a feminist who was often rude and nasty
   and who . . . did not even like women; of a wife who inflicted and
   received so much violence in her marriage that her three children
   required therapy to distance themselves from the emotional fallout.

   Despite the criticism, however, it is undeniably true that The Feminine
   Mystique spoke to many women whose lives were changed as a result of
   reading the book. For them, being a housewife was a negation of their
   potential as human beings, and they discovered the courage to reach out
   to make a different choice. But voices within feminism were not content
   to view domesticity simply as a choice that appealed to some women and
   not to others. So a new political mythology of housewifery was born.

The Myth of the Housewife

   In the 60s the mainstream of feminism was liberal and contained a
   strong bias toward reforming marriage to make it more equal. For
   example, men were exhorted to do more of the housework and to share
   greater responsibility for child rearing. In short, The Feminine
   Mystique did not call for the abolition of marriage, merely for a
   transformation. Years later, when politically correct gender feminism
   built on Friedans work to argue for the abolition of marriage, she
   objected. In her book The Second Stage (1981) she explained that gender
   feminists were misinterpreting her meaning.

   She pleaded with them to move away from antifamily rhetoric and back to
   a dialogue with men about how to improve the institution of marriage.

   What is the substance of the antifamily rhetoric to which Friedan
   objected?

   The gender feminist assault on the traditional family, including
   stay-at-home moms, can be dated from Kate Milletts influential book
   Sexual Politics (1970). Milletts views were extreme and her
   presentation radical. For example, in dealing with male-female
   relations (sexual politics), Millett dwelt almost obsessively on
   pornography and sado-masochistic literature. In attacking sexual
   politics she assaulted the entire structure of power in societythat
   is, the white male culture known as patriarchy. Marriage was posited as
   the agency that maintained the traditional pattern of mans power over
   woman.

   Milletts work was followed up and fleshed out by other extreme voices.
   Consider a small sampling of some books that quickly ensued: Ellen
   Pecks The Baby Trap (1971) argued that babies block liberation;
   Kathrin Perutzs Marriage is Hell (1972) defined heterosexual sex as a
   political power struggle; Jill Johnstons Lesbian Nation (1973) called
   heterosexual females traitors. The popular anthology Sisterhood is
   Powerful (1970) contained 74 essays; only one of them had anything to
   do with motherhood.

   A new theory of the housewife was evolving in which the role had the
   political status of chattel. To gender feminists, marriage and the
   family became inextricably bound up with private property, the class
   structure, and the mode of production. In other words, the family was
   an aspect of capitalism.

   The seeds of their analysis are to be found in Friedrich Engels,
   coauthor of the Communist Manifesto and an author much quoted by
   Millett. In his book The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and
   the State (1884) Engels argued that the oppression of women sprang from
   the nuclear family, but he did not believe that this oppression had
   occurred throughout history. It had emerged with the dawn of capitalism
   before which, he claimed, the work of men and of women was valued
   equally. In the nineteenth century, however, industrialization
   supposedly brought a separation between home and productive work and
   caused a transfer of mens labor from the home or farm to the
   factories. Women remained at the hearth. Thus men came to dominate the
   public realm and women were confined to the private one. Although some
   women ventured into the factories as well, they received lower pay and
   their independence was illusory.

   With the emergence of wide-scale capitalism, women were said to be
   relegated to the roles of breeding, maintaining men, and buying
   consumer goods. Mothers provided the next and appropriately
   indoctrinated generation of laborers for the capitalists; housewives
   maintained the male workforce by cleaning and cooking; housekeepers
   enriched the capitalist structure by consuming the products it
   produced.

   As the early gender feminists Nicole Cox and Silvia Federici explained
   in their pamphlet Counter-Planning from the Kitchen: Wages for
   Housework, Housework . . . is servicing the wage earner physically,
   emotionally, sexually, getting him ready to work day after day for the
   wage. It is taking care of our children . . . and ensuring that they
   too perform in ways expected of them under capitalism.

   To gender feminists housework is a direct expression of mans
   oppression of women and capitalisms exploitation. As such, housework
   is surplus labor. To restate the feminist concept: Capitalism is a
   process by which those who own the means of production pay wages to
   workers who produce goods worth more than the wages paid. The worth in
   excess of the wages paid is called the surplus value of labor and it
   is absorbed by capitalists as unearned profit. The surplus value of
   housework is that it enables mens labor. Mens labor is the unearned
   profit that capitalism absorbs.

   Thrown into this economic condemnation of housework and the traditional
   family as bastions of capitalism are other accusations. For example,
   housewives are said to be kept in an isolation that encourages domestic
   violence.

   From such analysis sprang the popular feminist slogan The personal is
   political. Susan Moller Okin explained the origins in her book
   Justice, Gender, and the Family (1991). Okin wrote, The earliest
   claims that the personal is political came from those gender feminists
   of the 1960s and 1970s who argued that, since the family was at the
   root of womens oppression, it must be smashed. She disputes the
   assumption that family arrangements should be treated as personal,
   private matters rather than as political ones: the state can and should
   enter the domestic scene.

   To those who object, Okin replies that the state already intervenes by
   establishing the social and political background in which the family
   functions. Expanding the intervention by, for example, requiring
   payment for housework is a matter of degree, not of kind.

   Whether or not Friedan is comfortable with the manner in which her
   theories have been spun out, this is the logical conclusion to her
   calling the suburban household a concentration camp for women. And so
   the new myth appears: stay-at-home moms are oppressed women who are so
   psychologically damaged by being trapped that they are likely to snap
   under the pressure. As isolated victims of male society, it is
   understandable if they experience psychotic episodes in which they kill
   their own children. Indeed, in doing so, they are expressing their
   victimhood, which has gone unrecognized by society at large.

A New/Old View of Housewifery

   Fortunately, voices of sanity remain. One of them belongs to Mimi
   Gladstein who speaks out in the individualist feminist book [from The
   Independent Institute] Liberty for Women (Ivan R. Dee, spring 2002).
   Individualist feminism views staying at home to raise a family as a
   choice every bit as valid as entering the work force. Gladsteins essay
   begins, We dont hire housewives, because that is the response she
   received when she asked about joining the faculty of the University of
   Texas at El Paso, where she is now associate dean of liberal arts.
   Gladstein refused to be devalued as a human being because she was a
   housewife. That jobno less than teaching university
   Englishexpressed her worth and her competence. Even more, being a
   housewife was the training ground where she learned skills such as
   setting priorities and budgeting time. Gladstein writes, All I really
   needed to know about chairing a department, I learned by being a Jewish
   Mother.

   Gladstein describes how being a suburban housewife trained her to
   handle taking over as executive director of her universitys Diamond
   Jubilee celebration. She writes, That job allowed me to use my
   housewifery skills to create and manage events as diverse as football
   half-times, city-wide street festivals, physics fairs, student
   retention programs, Vietnam Memorial dedications, city and university
   planning commissions and a year-long program of national and internally
   renowned speakers. She learned the necessary skills while juggling her
   childrens schedules, planning the family budget, and being a hostess
   at her husbands business events.

   Choice is the key to individualist feminism and to whether or not
   housework is damaging to women. To those women who choose to stay home
   and raise a family, it can be not only the most fulfilling use of their
   time, but it can also teach management skills that translate well into
   the workplace afterwards. In approaching marriage and the family, the
   feminist slogan should be: the personal is personal. Individuals
   should choose, and the state should have no role.

   A quarter of Indian men are engaged in unpaid chores, compared to
   four-fifths of women
   Soutik Biswas
   By Soutik Biswas
   India correspondent

   A newly formed political party in India, launched by a film star, has
   promised salaries to housewives if voted to power. A prominent MP
   welcomed the idea, saying it will "monetise the services of women
   homemakers, enhance their power and autonomy" and create a
   near-universal basic income.

   This is a compelling debate, especially at a time when women are losing
   ground in paid work. All around the world, women spend time in unpaid
   work - ranging from a maximum of 345 minutes per day in Iraq to 168
   minutes per day in Taiwan, according to International Labour
   Organisation. On average, men spent 83 minutes in unpaid care work
   while women spent three times more at 265 minutes.

   So should housewives be paid wages for doing largely thankless
   household chores?

   India's 160 million homemakers, like many of their counterparts in the
   rest of the world, clean, tidy, cook, wash up and manage family
   finances. They fetch food, water and firewood, and give care to
   children and their in-laws. They spend 297 minutes a day doing domestic
   work, compared to 31 minutes by men. A quarter of men are engaged in
   unpaid chores, compared to four-fifths of women.

   Legal scholar Gautam Bhatia has argued that unpaid housework is "forced
   labour". Arpan Tulsiyan, a research scholar at Delhi University, says
   it is "important to recognise the value of unpaid domestic work".

   What is not well known is that for more than half-a-century, Indian
   courts have actually been awarding compensation for unpaid work done by
   homemakers. But only after their death.

   Housework has traditionally been treated as a woman's responsibility in
   India

   Prabha Kotiswaran, a professor of law and justice at King's College
   London, has looked at about 200 cases between 1968 and 2021 filed under
   an Indian law that regulates all road transport vehicles and imposes
   penalties for rash driving, among other things.

   She found that the country's courts had developed a "path-breaking"
   legal framework concerning "robust wages for housework": judges have
   put a value on unpaid work of women who have died in road accidents and
   awarded compensation to their dependants.

   In calculating the value of housework, judges have looked at
   opportunity cost - which is something that is given up in order to do
   something else - of a woman's decision to work at home, considered
   minimum wages for skilled and unskilled workers, taken into account
   educational qualifications of the deceased woman, and adjusted
   compensations after accounting for age and considering whether she had
   children or not.

   In December, a court awarded a compensation of 1.7 million rupees
   ($23,263; £17,019) to the family of a 33-year-old homemaker who died in
   a road accident, after fixing her notional salary at 5,000 rupees a
   month.

   The Supreme Court has awarded lump sum amounts up to 9,000 rupees a
   month as a notional income for a deceased housewife aged between 34-59
   years with a lower amount for elderly women, aged between 62-72.
   Compensation decreased with age as courts believed she would be doing
   less childcare work as children grew up.

   Wherever possible, the judges have tried to keep pace with inflation.
   In one judgement, the judges viewed marriage as an "equal economic
   partnership" so that the homemaker's salary would be half of the
   husband's salary.

   The earliest case of such compensation found by Prof Kotiswaran was a
   ruling from 1966. In that case, the court ruled that the cost to the
   husband of "maintaining" his wife would have been equal to her imagined
   salary, so no compensation was awarded to him.

   Some of the compensation payments calculated by the courts have been
   "paltry", Prof Kotiswaran says, but "the principle itself of the
   recognition of unpaid work on par with an occupation is quite
   noteworthy".

   It begs the question: if a family can be compensated for unpaid work
   done by a woman after she has died, why not pay women when they are
   alive?

   Lawyers may be able to use these judgments to "trigger developments in
   constitutional law and family laws to recognise the unpaid work of
   housewives in normal times, rather than only at times of disruption",
   Prof Kotiswaran says. Paying wages to women doing unpaid work at home
   would also boost India's declining female labour participation rate.

   "I am not arguing only for salaries for housewives, but for a broader
   wages-for-housework movement. Organisations like UN Women are too
   focused on how unpaid work is an obstacle to paid work," Prof
   Kotiswaran says. "The focus seems to be on how to get more women into
   paid work. The Indian women's movement is focused on many laudable
   issues but is not asking the big question here about labour performed
   within marriage."

   There's also no mass mobilisation of housewives over the issue, she
   says. "Most elites think that salaries for housewives is unworkable at
   best and regressive at worst, but there is a case for a broader
   political argument about recognition of housework. I do think that
   women in millions of Indian households, subject to the drudgery of
   maintaining home, will welcome a proposal for salaries."

   There are a lot of questions about how this can be achieved.

   Should the money for the wages come from cash transfers, state
   subsidies or a universal basic income? Should family laws be changed to
   recognise women's unpaid work? Should men performing housework also be
   remunerated? Should transgender women be included in these payment
   schemes? What could be the unintended consequences of salaries for
   housewives?

   "We need a more sustained conversation on all of these aspects before
   mobilising for salaries for housewives," says Prof Kotiswaran.

Unpacking ‘Housewife’ And Its Problematic Implications

   Housewife as a word is complicit in the erasure of agency of married
   women by defining them in terms of their relationships and the domestic
   obligations that correspond.
   By Rohitha Naraharisetty Jan 7, 2019 4 min read

   The word ‘housewife’ is the product of the marriage (pun intended)
   between capitalism and patriarchy, where breaking the word up yields
   two of the factors from each ideology which ultimately determine a
   woman’s social location. ‘House’ indicates the site of labour – the
   private sphere, and with ‘wife’ being an ascribed status in relation to
   a man legally bound as a husband through the marriage contract. Put
   together, the words naturalises the role of a married woman as the one
   to perform unpaid domestic labour in the home.

   In other words, being a wife and performing unpaid labour become
   synonymous with each other. Housewife as a word is complicit in the
   erasure of agency of married women by defining them in terms of their
   relationships and the domestic obligations that correspond. Recognition
   of the word’s implications for nullifying self determination and agency
   renders it incompatible with a feminist politics which works to
   dismantle structural conditions of oppression, with language playing a
   key role in the same.

     Work ascribed to women is not only valued less but also cheapened
     with the help of patriarchy which privileges masculinity over
     femininity.

   In order to unpack why ‘housewife’ is a problematic word, the idea of
   ‘work’ must be problematised. One of the key ideas that capitalism
   tries to sell is the equation of financial capital with agency. What is
   left unquestioned is the kind of work which is monetarily valued under
   capitalism and the kind which is not. Most often, work ascribed to
   women according to traditional gender roles are not only valued less,
   it is also cheapened with the help of the patriarchy which privileges
   masculinity over femininity. As a result, the work which women do, or
   are associated with doing, is valued less and feminine labour such as
   care-work and domestic chores become relegated to the unpaid or lesser
   paid end of the work spectrum.

   Traditionally, masculine jobs are paid for and have hence been defined
   over time as ‘work’ as per a capitalist definition which incorporates
   income and profit into its logics. To then use the word housewife for
   women who don’t “work”, therefore, is to not only leave the idea of
   work unproblematised, it is also actively playing into a capitalist
   patriarchal ideology which requires a whole section of people’s work to
   be undervalued and therefore unpaid in order to sustain the machinery
   of production and profit.

     If a wife’s duty, according to gender norms, is to sustain the
     family, the work which she does in the house in order to do so is
     her natural role and must therefore not be paid for.

   The word also serves the essential function of devaluing domestic
   labour itself; by setting it up as oppositional to ‘actual work’, it
   implicitly negates the use value of work performed at home in order to
   make it sound logical to not have this work be paid for. If a wife’s
   duty, according to gender norms, is to sustain the family, the work
   which she does in the house in order to do so is her natural role and
   must therefore not be paid for. The naturalisation of this work also
   allows for it to be viewed as unskilled work, and further contributes
   to the devaluation of the same.

   Ultimately, the word comes with all of these implications in order to
   justify not paying for or recognising domestic labour as real work.
   Additionally, the word allows for the privatisation of care and
   domestic labour due to the fact that reinforcing the easy congruity
   between housework and being a wife enables the state or governing
   entity to relegate this to the private sphere and not view it as worthy
   of public investment.

   The implications of the word in lieu of all of these hidden meaning,
   therefore, are many. It reinforces the public/private divide which is
   often cited by many feminist scholars as a distinction that excludes
   women from integrating into civil society by confining them to their
   traditional gender roles within the private sphere.

   It is also not gender neutral, as unpaid labour in the home as the
   domain of the work that housewives do is specific to women; with its
   association with femininity, men escape the devaluation and therefore
   do not have a commonly used counterpart to the word housewife. The word
   when used for women ties in capitalist exploitation with patriarchal
   subordination to create an identity which does not allow for thinking
   about these women as having agency of their own.

     When being a ‘housewife’ is associated with “not working,” the
     importance of domestic labour in sustaining capitalism is swept
     aside and women are made to feel devalued as subjects themselves.

   While unpaid domestic work must be challenged for its devaluation, the
   power dynamics within an employer-employee relationship under
   capitalism may have the harmful potential to exacerbate women’s
   subordination in their roles as wives. It must be noted that the
   function which unpaid labour performs for capitalist patriarchy is
   reproduction of labour power, or work which allows for someone else to
   re-enter the workforce to engage in paid labour everyday. When being a
   ‘housewife’ is associated with ‘not working’, the importance of
   domestic labour in sustaining capitalism is swept aside and women are
   made to feel devalued as subjects themselves.

   There is therefore a need for a new word which recognises these
   inconsistencies with respect to feminist practice, which would then
   interrogate the conditions leading to devaluation of work instead of
   allowing the same to sustain themselves through the word. While
   ‘homemaker’ is one such alternative that has gained mainstream traction
   and does away with the ‘wife’ suffix, it still does not address the
   fact that capitalism relies on the devaluation of this work and of the
   people who do it in order to perpetuate itself, and once again leaves
   the oppressive origins of such work unproblematised.

   Also read: Unpaid Domestic Labour and the Invisibilisation of Women’s
   Work

   A new word for unpaid domestic labour can be conceptualised once the
   question of work itself is deconstructed, which may then address the
   question of ascribing value to different kinds of work according to
   gender norms and stereotype.

            Hi, thank you for your comment! Phrase-making indeed plays a
            vital role toward creating and sustaining discourses which can

            Thanks for the comment! That’s an interesting suggestion; I
            was thinking more along the lines of a word that would do away

       Completely agree…I being in and out of job would recommend ‘Home
       Manager’ as an appropriate title as it is actually managing the
       entire home affairs and it’s no joke. In fact the outside home
       working partners must lawfully hand over a salary for that!!

   Can I call myself a housewife if I’m not married anymore? There’s a
   question I asked myself while I indulged in a little Real Housewives of
   OC. It’s my guilty pleasure on those lonely nights where the children
   are at their father’s. I live in the OC and it’s my dream to have a
   series of the show made here in Canberra - they won’t even have to
   change the title.

   (And neighbours, don’t you worry, I already have the cast picked out.
   You have a starring role. All that - to quote the show’s credentials -
   “living large, plastic surgery, working out, shopping, drinking and
   dancing” we’re doing every night in the inner north.)
   James Gandolfini and Julia Louis Dreyfus in Enough Said, a marvellous
   film.

   James Gandolfini and Julia Louis Dreyfus in Enough Said, a marvellous
   film.

   But I digress. I do that sometimes.

   Can I call myself a housewife if I’m not married anymore? There’s a few
   definitions of housewife. I like this one: “A housewife is a woman who
   has chosen to not work outside the home for money, but rather devotes
   all time, energy and love into creating a safe, warm, clean home for
   her family to grow and thrive. She cooks, cleans, does dishes, laundry,
   childcare, shopping, countless errands and careful money management all
   while supporting her family and community through community service
   work, volunteering and general parenting.”

   I did all of those things while I was married - and working, mind you -
   and I do all those things now. Even in the weeks I’m on my own. (And
   are you ever really on your own when the kids are texting because
   they’ve forgotten to take something, or just need your advice, or your
   credit card number.) So maybe I am still a housewife.

   But other definitions make mention of said woman being married. And I’m
   definitely not that - it’s actually official now - and for as much as I
   love my home, and I am committed to it, it’s not really a marriage.

   So what am I if not a housewife?

Spinster

   I reckon I could rock this one. I’ve already been called Aunty Karen by
   a few kids to whom I am not related by blood. I don’t think I’d mind
   being that crazy aunt who turns up at family events even though she is
   not family. But then what is family? That’s a whole different
   discussion. But does the term spinster imply I’ve never been married?
   The stereotype of being “childless, prissy and repressed” doesn’t fit
   me at all. Does it? But I like spinster. Its etymology goes back to the
   day where unmarried women of a certain age filled menial jobs, such as
   spinning wool. I like to think that being single means I can put my
   spin on anything.

The gay divorcee

   Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers set the tone in their 1934 musical which
   was quite risque for its time. Ginger arrives in England, seeking a
   divorce from her husband whom she has not seen for several years. Back
   then, there needed to be some fault - I guess the husband choosing to
   absent was not his fault - so her bumbling lawyer arranges a set-up
   where she will be caught in an adulterous relationship in a seaside
   hotel and thus, the fault would be hers. She mistakes Fred for the
   set-up lothario, the pair sing and dance the night away.

   Sounds kind of like my life. But with less singing and dancing. Must
   rectify that.

   And if I’m thinking of other films, where divorced women lead a gay old
   life, check out Meryl Streep in It’s Complicated (but stay clear of
   Kramer v Kramer), Julia Dreyfus in Enough Said, a marvellous film,  and
   Diane Keaton in Hampstead, which I have only just found. There is hope.

Cougar

   I tried the younger man thing. It wasn’t for me. In my limited
   experience there is long line of young men who are looking for an older
   woman. They’re all looking for a woman who is sure of herself, who
   isn’t caught up in worrying about what other people think of her, a lot
   of them probably just have mummy issues but, when the mood strikes, I'm
   not going to apologise for the fact I like interacting with younger
   men. In theory it sounded fabulous. In practice it wasn’t. In fact the
   sexiest men I’ve met are men in their 60s. Perhaps I could find a sugar
   daddy? In practice that might prove impossible too. Could I be a sugar
   mumma? I doubt that. So too does my bank manager.

All the single ladies

   I’m having an existential discussion with myself about whether or not I
   can call myself a single mother. I’m a single woman who just happens to
   be a mother. I don’t parent by myself.

   I tried listening to Beyonce’s anthem for inspiration but really there
   seemed to be a lot of emphasis on putting a ring on something. But
   that’s not going to happen. I would like to be able to a) dance like
   that in heels and b) have legs like that. But that’s not going to
   happen either.

   What’s going to happen is that I can spend the next 30 or so years
   living my life without any label at all. Putting my own spin on things,
   singing and dancing, spending time with whom I choose. Not a bad way to
   define myself.

Southfield housewife believes women should stay home
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jasmin Barmore   Detroit Free Press

   Tiffany Willis wakes up every morning between 5:30 a.m. and 6 a.m. in
   the Southfield home she shares with her husband of six years.

   There is no chatter of children getting ready for school.

   There is no job waiting for her to punch in.

   Instead, she gets up to hang out with her husband, Lamar Willis, and to
   do everything to meet his every daily need. She has prepared his lunch
   the night before and laid out his clothes, "so when he gets up to start
   his day, he can just kind of operate,” she said.

   The two chat while he puts on the pants and button-down shirt that she
   neatly pressed for him the day before. They joke around as she makes
   his coffee and sends him out the door.

   New York Fashion Week

   After he leaves for work, Tiffany Willis spends time meditating before
   doing her daily household “chores.”

   But she has to finish by 2 p.m., she said, because that is when it is
   time for her to prepare her home for her husband to re-enter once he
   gets off work.

   “Either I’m baking something for him, or filling our home with some
   sort of good scent for him to come home to,” she said.

   Willis, 36, is a housewife. In fact, she says, she is a proud
   housewife. And she said she understands that her path is not for
   everyone and that some people cringe at the word housewife and the June
   Cleaver images of subservience that it can conjure up for many women
   today. In fact, she says, she frequently gets pushback on her social
   media pages from other women — and even some men — accusing her of
   supporting misogyny as a woman and of erasing the progress women have
   made over the decades.

   But Tiffany Willis pushes back — not in an offensive way — that what
   she is trying to do is not set women back, she is trying to prop them
   up. And she does this through her online Wifestyle Academy where she
   seeks to teach women not only to take care of their relationship, but
   how to tap into their "feminine energy," what she describe as the
   calming, peaceful presence in women that makes them appealing,
   alluring, nurturing and powerful.

   At The Wifestyle Academy, Tiffany says she focuses on helping women to
   find their voice with her six-week Feminine But Firm: Setting
   Boundaries Like a Lady, digital course. After they are able to find
   their voice, she said, a woman can better advocate for what she wants
   and needs.

   “It just bugs me when women don't feel empowered to advocate for
   themselves,” she says. “And contrary to one’s belief, housewifery gives
   a woman the power to really advocate for themselves. But they have to
   see themselves as valuable first, and then they have to protect that
   value.”

   Dr. Rose Moten, a clinical psychiatrist, life transformation coach and
   founder of the BLOOM Transformation Center, in Detroit, says the idea
   of women staying in the home and the man bringing home the bacon is a
   rarity today as opposed to our grandparents generation. And she said
   it's especially true given that, statistically, Black women tend to
   have higher rates of attaining college degrees than Black men.

   1968

   “There are many women who are just, they are not hard wired to want to
   be a housewife” Moten, a mom of four, says. “They have lots of
   contributions that they want to give to the world.”

   Reflecting on when she was married to her children’s father, Moten said
   she enjoyed her time away from the home when she was working. In fact,
   she says, for her, she felt as if it was more work to do inside the
   home than outside the home. So, being able to work outside the home,
   for her, is important.

   “That's a 24/7 job that's oftentimes not appreciated with the amount of
   work that you have to put in and running a household.”

   But, according to 44-year-old Tamara Anderson, “Everyone needs a
   Tiffany in their life.” Anderson says that she took the Feminine But
   Firm course in April because she believed in what Tiffany was teaching
   and speaking over her social media pages.

   “I had done the opposite," Anderson, who is a divorced mom, said. “So
   with me doing the opposite, I knew that what she was saying was true.”

   Anderson said Tiffany’s course breathed life back into her and helped
   her to be okay with speaking up for herself. She says after losing her
   voice in her marriage, and getting mentally and emotionally “beat up”
   in a relationship before her marriage because she wanted to end things,
   Tiffany Willis helped her to understand that she has to honor her
   voice.

   “It got so bad that I became a professional ghoster” Anderson said
   laughing. “If you look up the word 'ghosting' my face was painted right
   next to it … and so yes, I was like the person that if I didn’t like
   something that someone did or said, I would just not say anything and
   just be mad.”

   What Tiffany Willis is teaching, according to a recent Pew study, is
   part of a rise in stay-at-home moms vs moms that work outside the home,
   where Black moms came in third compared to other races. White women
   were the least likely to stay at home, while Hispanic women came in
   second and Asians women came in first. The study shows that many
   factors play into why Hispanics and Asians come in at the top for women
   who stay in the house instead of working outside of the home. A main
   factor, the research says, is that many of these women are immigrants.

   While Tiffany and her husband do not have children, she says they are
   actively trying to conceive and have been for some time now. When the
   couple does become parents, Tiffany Willis said she will continue to
   stay in the house and take care of the child.

   Her choices may seem out of sync with many women, but they certainly
   jibe with husband and father Larry Blocker, who does not know Willis,
   but said he gets what she is trying to do.

   Blocker, 67, said that he believes having a wife who takes care of home
   is a good thing because it helps to build stronger families.

   “If you go back into the 60’s when I was born, it was more dads in the
   house,” Blocker said. “They were out there doing the heavy lifting, and
   the moms were taking care of (the children).. . And so that was always
   a better situation because Black women were able to nurture the kids
   and get them up and going so that they can know right from wrong.”

   But it's not just about creating strong homes and families, it's about
   women claiming their voice. Tiffany says women have never been given
   permission to advocate for themselves. Aside from the grandparents and
   great-grandparents era, when women were considered feminine because
   they were quiet and home taking care of the house and children, Tiffany
   says women are not even comfortable advocating for themselves in the
   bedroom.

   “Advocating for sexual needs is huge,” she says. “Empowering women to
   have a voice in their sexual likes and dislikes reduces the chances she
   will become a victim to what is supposed to be enjoyable for both
   parties.”

   Moten agrees that women should feel empowered to advocate for
   themselves. She also believes that “this is not a one-size-fits-all
   remedy.”

   “You (a woman) can have your voice, and you can advocate for yourself,
   and still be a BOSS, and/or work outside of the home … and it does not
   mean you are any less delicate or feminine because you decide
   housewifery is not for you.”

   She also cautions about the dangers of dedicating one's life solely
   sole to taking care of a spouse.

   In her book, "Bloom: 7 Steps to Personal Transformation," Moten — or
   Dr. Bloom as she also is known to some — discusses a former client who
   dedicated herself to taking care of her husband. The woman married a
   man who was into politics and shortly after they were married she
   became a housewife.

   “He told her there was a certain look she has to have now and that she
   couldn’t wear her hair in the different ethnic hairstyles she wore
   before because her hairstyles need to represent the wife of a
   politician. And she became depressed,” Moten said.

   Tiffany Willis said she is aware of such pitfalls, which is why: “When
   I walk women through those things that make them valuable,” she
   identifies the pieces of the woman that cannot be taken away and that
   should not be taken away.

   Willis says when a woman finds herself abandoning those pieces “that
   make you, you,” they are giving up themselves, their voice and their
   power.

   Forty-one-year-old Rondre Brooks, who has been engaged twice but never
   married and recently just ended a long-term relationship, says he would
   want his partner to do whatever makes her happy.

   “I prefer for her to do the things that make her feel fulfilled," he
   said. “If that is work, work … I don’t play gender roles. If a woman
   enjoys cutting the grass, she can cut the grass.”

   Brooks, who grew up on the eastside of Detroit and is a father and
   Realtor, said his mother was a stay-at-home wife and his dad made the
   money. It worked for them. But he does believe that the woman staying
   home and the man doing all the heavy lifting is the “old way of
   thinking.”

   Blocker says his current wife stays at home. The two moved from Detroit
   to Houston together once Blocker retired a little over three years ago.
   He built her a salon in their home simply so she could have her own
   independence and because that's what she likes to do.

   “She was working in Michigan, but when we came out here (Houston), I
   didn't really want her to do a lot of work,” he said. “But you know,
   most women, they want their own money and independence, so I set up a
   studio in the house for her to do hair in.”

   Before she married Lamar, Tiffany said she dated and had to carry the
   brunt of everything for herself. One date, however, was the last straw.

   “We were at the end of our date, everything was going fine. And then
   the check came. He was like, ‘So we're just gonna work this out 50/50,
   right?’ And I was like, 'Well, you, invited me out.' ” And she said she
   knew from there where she had gone wrong.

   “It was my energy," she said. “I had just read out all my
   accomplishments to him, he said, and he felt I was okay with providing
   for myself because I basically had told him I could.”

   Tiffany defines this energy as “masculine energy” and says many women
   today still move in that energy.

   “Either she's been let down, or led astray like I was in the past, and
   now what we do is take the 'You know what, forget it, I’ll do it'
   approach, and that's not the right energy to move in.”

   Anderson says she too has moved in that so-called "masculine energy" in
   her prior relationships. Today, after successfully completing The Wife
   Style Boundaries course, she said she still is healing from that place
   of where she was disappointed or let down by a past partner. But if she
   ever does get married again, she said, she hopes her husband will have
   the same mindset as Tiffany’s husband and Blocker. And in return, she
   will make sure her partner does not come home to "chaos."

   “A Black man, in general, deals with so much when they leave the home,
   such as, if they will come home that night for dinner. So that's my
   job; that when he walks through that door, he's walking into his own
   little piece of heaven” she said.

   A bliss of paradise is what Tiffany Willis says her husband comes home
   to every day. And, she said, it has made her a better woman by doing
   so. Along with the income she earns from The Wifestyle Academy, and her
   baking company, Willis Wife Bakes, she uses it she says to spoil her
   hubby.

   “Aside from helping other women, I started the academy because I wanted
   to take my husband to Jamaica for his birthday. I celebrate my husband
   every chance I get” she said.

   And on Saturday, Tiffany, is taking the American man made holiday:
   Sweetest Day — that was originally created by an employee from a
   Cleveland candy store in 1922 in an effort to bring happiness to the
   forgotten, and reserved today as the men's Valentine's Day by those who
   celebrate it — to honor her hubby, Lamar Willis, with a Detroit theme
   date night that starts with a massage earlier in the day from their
   monthly spa package that Lamar pays for.

   “I became a housewife to simply take my power back,” she said.

World Mental Health Day 2022: Working woman vs housewife; is one more
stressed than the other? Experts answer

   Updated on Oct 10, 2022 09:14 AM IST

World Mental Health Day 2022: Be it a working woman or a housewife, the daily
duties seem to be never-ending for females - from taking care of kitchen,

   World Mental Health Day 2022:World Mental Health Day (October 10) is
   almost here and it is the perfect time to talk about mental health of
   women who often juggle with multiple responsibilities. Be it a working
   woman or a housewife, the daily duties seem to be never-ending for
   females - from taking care of kitchen, children, elderly to their
   individual goals. This puts them at an increased risk of depression,
   anxiety and other such mental health issues. (Also read: Diabetes to
   arthritis: 5 chronic diseases that can lead to depression)

   A survey conducted by Researchgate which saw participation of 80
   married women in the age ranging from 25-40 years, including 40 married
   working women and 40 housewives, noted that while working women
   experience financial independence, high self-esteem the house wife may
   experience insecurity and poor social life etc. The survey concluded
   that married working women and the housewives have their own set of
   issues which may cause difference in their quality of life. On the
   occasion of World Mental Health Day, we asked mental health experts
   about the unique challenges of working woman and a housewife and also
   if one is more stressed than the other.

   "There are several reasons due to which women's mental health gets
   affected. There are biological, social and cultural reasons with an
   undeniable gender difference in the incidence and prevalence of mental
   health disturbances," says Dr. RC Jiloha, Senior Consultant -
   Psychiatry, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram.

What ails the mental health of a housewife

   "Housewives spend their entire time dedicated to routine chores but
   that is not the case with working women and hence they are good at
   grooming and taking care of themselves," says Dr Jiloha.

   The psychiatrist says that while staying at home allows a lot of
   leisure time but it affects the person mentally. He adds that working
   allows women to be independent that may help prevent negative thoughts.

   "India, over the years, has witnessed a lot of domestic violence cases
   and the backwardness of the society has its own shortcomings. Working
   allows women to make decisions, be independent and wake up to be
   confident every single day. None of these scenarios is met with a
   housewife and that somehow gives them time and space to welcome a
   plethora of negative thoughts. At work, you tend to be practical and
   take opinions about solving problems. But it is an upside-down episode
   when you stay at home. Society looks at a housewife’s chores as if it
   is her duty and why should there be rewards? No one appreciates it.
   Hence, there is a lot of dissatisfaction and anxiety. A working woman
   has no time to think of disappointments," says Dr Jiloha.

   "In various households, the housewives fell prey to the frustrations
   and aggression of their male counterparts. There is a perpetual burden
   of keeping the family tied up together along with bearing the financial
   issues and still keeping the family happy together by taking care of
   all the members of the family – husbands as well as the in-laws was a
   very challenging task for housewives. There is also a rising tension of
   sexual dissatisfaction between husband and wife. According to a
   research in this area, 70% Indian women do not have orgasm during
   sexual intercourse. Sexual dissatisfaction leads to many mental
   disorders like neurosis and even Oedipus complex sometimes in worse
   cases," says Dr. Jyoti Kapoor, Founder and Senior Psychiatrist,
   Manasthali.

   Dr Kapoor says some of common triggers of mental health problems in
   housewives are episodes of depression and anxiety, marital
   dissatisfaction, domestic violence and patriarchal ideologies.

   Mental health challenges of working women

   To think about leisure time is a dream for working woman as even off
   days are dedicated to finishing off pending chores while worrying about
   how they children are performing at school. Any free time from office
   work is utilised in a domestic chore while leaves little leisure time
   for working women. The burnout may be visible in form of decreasing
   work productivity and loss of interest in household work.

   "A 9-hour shift itself is a challenge and the moonlighting trend has
   somehow worsened the work routines. On top of that if an individual has
   a layer of another set of responsibilities it becomes adverse to mental
   as well as physical health. Working women need to be an expert at
   multitasking. She has to remember everything beforehand without making
   many mistakes. Kids are a big responsibility and so is look forward to
   preparing meals every single day. A working woman manages her finances
   and the moods of every family member. In normal circumstances it is
   still manageable but when she’s ill, how can the doer expect something
   to be done for her? All these roles and responsibilities exhaust her
   and the burnout is excessive to drain her mentally," says Dr Jiloha.

   Working women vs housewives: who is more stressed?

   "Both have their own set of pros and cons but a working woman is more
   productive end of the day. Working can also include taking tuition or
   having a small business, like selling pickles etc. This can make them
   financially independent and garner their knowledge of many things. She
   can be confident and polish her communication skills while dealing with
   various clients and colleagues. Though both have their level of anxiety
   and stress, a working woman is far happier in what she does and has no
   space for negativity in her mind. She makes friends at work who are
   ambitious like her and help her deal with the issues of life. Such
   behaviour helps in maintaining mental health," says Dr Jiloha.

   Dr Kapoor says anybody can be stressed or depressed and one doesn’t
   need to have a certain profession.

   "We cannot say that only working women or housewives are stressed.
   Stress can stem from anything or anybody around you," she says.

What's so bad about being a housewife?

   After reading a recent study that suggests women would rather be
   divorced than doing dishes, Jennifer defends the “traditional” role of
   housewives.

   Jennifer Pinarski February 11, 2013

   Photo by SuburbanSport via Flickr.

   When I’m in the mood for snark and irreverence, Jezebel never
   disappoints. This week, housewives were under fire with the headline
   “Most Women Would Rather Kick Their Husbands to the Curb Than Be a
   Housewife” catching my attention.

   Highlighting research from Kathleen Gerson’s 2009 book, The Unfinished
   Revolution, Jezebel pokes fun at the 1950s stereotype of a woman who
   stays home while her husband brings home the bacon, calling this
   traditional role “quaint.” After all, doesn’t every woman want to be
   totally equal with her partner? That’s what 80% of women and 70% of men
   want — at least according to Gerson’s research.

   But when Gerson asked study subjects what they would do it they found
   themselves in a relationship where men and women couldn’t sustain an
   equal partnership, 75% of women said they would rather ask their
   husband for a divorce than stay in a marriage that had them home with
   their children. My friend, Chantal, was shocked at the statistic which
   stated that 70% of men who were asked the same question said they hoped
   their wives would “de-prioritize” their career and focus on homemaking.

   Instead of jumping on the bandwagon of saying men don’t care about
   women’s careers — which is what the bulk of commenters wrote on Jezebel
   — I want to flip this statistic around and highlight what depresses me:
   Only 25% of Gerson’s female study subjects would choose their kids over
   their career. To me this study says less about the importance of women
   in the workplace than it does about how little young, unmarried people
   value family.

   Believe me, I didn’t grow up dreaming of being a stay-at-home mom, and
   if I had been part of that same study group 15 years ago I would have
   answered that question the same way. But marriage and children have a
   funny way of changing your priorities and, after having our second
   child, my husband and I decided that the best place for me to be was at
   home — a joint decision based on the fact that his income could support
   this choice and mine could not.

   There are moments in my new life as a housewife that my 20-year-old
   career-minded self would have cringed at, but now, as a stay-at-home
   parent who does most of the cooking and cleaning, I can say confidently
   that divorce is not the option I would choose. But if the misconception
   that a housewife’s role in a marriage is little more than cooking the
   bacon her husband brings home, of course divorce seems more attractive
   to a singleton. Truth is, being a housewife isn’t the same as being an
   unpaid janitor — and to see us as such is insulting. I see myself not
   only as a full-time caregiver to my children but, most importantly, to
   my marriage (I consider chores to be pesky side jobs of what I see as
   the real job of a housewife).

   Here are statistics I’d like to see 15 years from now, should
   initiatives like income splitting and tax breaks be put in place,
   enabling more parents to stay home to care for their marriages and
   children:
     * how children read and sing more often and are more literate
     * how divorce rates will fall
     * how youth crime will be reduced
     * how children eat healthier and have fewer cases of diabetes
     * how children play outside more and obesity is obsolete

   Hopefully some mommy blogger like me will say, “look at that old study
   from 2009, when they thought that being a housewife didn’t matter. How
   quaint.”

   Housewife 'would be paid £30,000'

   Clothes Pegs
   Nearly three-quarters of those polled said it was a full-time job

   Housewives would be paid more than the average worker if they received
   the going rate for their household chores, a survey has suggested.

   A poll of 4,000 housewives for networking website alljoinon.com
   suggested that the average mum worked for nearly nine hours a day every
   day.

   The website said a housewife would earn almost £30,000 a year if she
   was employed to do all the same errands.

   The average annual UK wage is £23,700, according to official figures.

   Some 71% of those polled agreed that successfully running the family
   home was a full-time job.

   "The survey clearly demonstrates that not only do housewives deserve a
   wage for their efforts, they also need a break from the daily grind,"
   said Carolyn Morris, spokeswoman for alljoinon.com.

   The chores are yours

   An average mum would spend 273 minutes every day looking after the
   children, according to the poll. Based on an hourly rate of £8, a nanny
   would earn £36.80 a day for the same job.

   Woman holding iron
   The survey claims 71 minutes a day is spent cleaning and tidying

   Cleaning and tidying for 71 minutes would net a cleaner £7.10 a day.
   For more than an hour of cooking a head chef would get £17.30.

   Fourteen minutes making the beds is worth £1.29 for a chambermaid, and
   a kitchen assistant would be paid £2.57 for a housewife's typical 28
   minutes of washing up.

   The poll said the average mum trawled the family finances for 39
   minutes, which would cost £12.50 if an accountant did it.

   A taxi driver would earn £2.53 for the 23 minutes of ferrying children
   around, and a mystery shopper £2.10 for the 18 minutes a day of grocery
   shopping.

   Single women 'do less'

   HAVE YOUR SAY

     Would you really want to put a price on your wife? I'd rather pitch
     in and do my fair share.

   James, Belfast
   Send us your comments
   Last year, a study said that employed women living with their employed
   partner spent more time doing housework than single women.

   Labour economist Helene Couprie, of Toulouse University, concluded that
   on average, an employed woman does 15 hours a week of housework when
   she lives with her employed partner, up from 10 hours when single.

   Men, on the other hand, see the hours they commit to housework decline
   once they begin living as a couple, she found.

   In the year to April 2007, average earnings of full-time male employees
   were £498 per week, while for women it was £394, according to the
   Office of National Statistics.

who are happy to put their family before their careers

     * There's a growing movement of young people taking on traditional
       gender roles
     * They come from the generation of millennials celebrating their
       independence
     * Almost a third of millennials believe men are best suited to being
       breadwinners

   When he turns his key in the lock of his London home at the end of a
   long day, Daniel Tredget knows he will be greeted by an immaculate
   house, a hot meal and — more often than not — the delicious,
   soul-warming smell of a freshly baked cake.

   While Daniel, who works as an accountant, has spent his day immersed in
   spreadsheets and client meetings, his wife, Emily, will have spent hers
   sieving flour, chopping vegetables and ironing his shirts.

   It's a domestic set-up straight out of the Fifties, which bears little
   resemblance to the frantic, juggling lifestyles of most families today.
   Yet Daniel and Emily aren't a staid, middle-aged couple set in their
   ways. At just 30 and 28 respectively, they're the most modern of
   Britons: millennials.
   When 29-year-old Cathy Abrampah announced that she was giving up her
   £35,000-a-year job for the Financial Ombudsman to be a stay-at-home
   mum, her friends and family were staggered. Cathy and her husband,
   Kuma, are pictured above with their one-year-old, Omari

   Born between the early Eighties and late Nineties, millennials are from
   a generation that celebrates its liberal values, priding itself on
   equality in all things — especially between the genders. But lately,
   there has been a sense of rebellion among the ranks.

   Why? Increasing numbers of high-flying millennial women are turning
   their backs on the workplace to be stay-at-home mothers.

   Recent studies have found that young adults are more likely than their
   parents to support traditional gender roles, with a study published in
   the Psychology of Women Quarterly finding that 32 per cent of
   millennials believe men are best suited to being breadwinners and women
   homemakers. This figure is up an incredible 27 per cent from the
   Nineties.

   The figures tie in with those showing the popularity of marriage is
   rising after 40 years' decline and that millennials are more socially
   conservative than previous generations.

   The movement is also fuelled by glossy websites and blogs that promote
   staying at home to women — one such site offers a support group to
   millennial housewives, while the hashtag #wifelife has around
   half-a-million mentions on Instagram.

   So, why are young women ditching hard-won — and often lucrative — jobs
   in favour of homemaking? It's certainly not because of a dearth of
   career options. Millennial women outstripped their male peers at school
   and university, entered professions such as medicine and law in greater
   numbers than men and now out-earn them in the workplace — by an average
   of £1,111 a year.

   Emily has five A-grade A-levels, a degree in material sciences from
   Oxford and had a high-flying job as a strategic consultant at drinks
   company Innocent before giving birth to her son, Oliver, who is now
   two.

   'I never in a million years thought I'd be a stay-at-home mum,' she
   says. Emily returned to work two days a week when Oliver was a year
   old, but she was quickly disillusioned.

   'It just didn't work for me,' she says. 'I've always given 150 per cent
   to any job I've had — and suddenly, I couldn't.'
   Cathy explains that her decision to be a stay-at-home mum was fuelled
   by a desire to recreate her own idyllic childhood

   This fear of no longer excelling is what clinical psychologist
   Christine Langhoff believes is prompting some high-flying millennial
   mothers — unused to failure after years of shining educationally — to
   quit the world of work.

   'Women who are highly educated often fall into the perfectionist
   category, and they don't want to do a mediocre job,' she explains.

   'Educated women also understand the benefits of being there when the
   children are little, and will see their time at home as valuable
   breathing space from the frenetic pace of life, where they can apply
   themselves to motherhood wholeheartedly.'

   Emily, whose own mother stayed at home, found that trying to juggle her
   job and motherhood left her feeling inadequate on all fronts.

   giving birth to her son. Now she's a stay-at-home mum

   'One day, my mum was looking after my son while I was at work and we
   had a meningitis scare. She had to take him to A&amp;E and I had to leave
   work early to go to the hospital,' says Emily.

   'I felt awful. It was in my first month back at work, a new job, and I
   remember thinking that no one would believe I could be relied on to be
   there.'

   However, while Emily's decision to quit her job left her free to focus
   on motherhood, it also meant sacrificing a £40,000 salary. Managing
   solely on her husband's income means the couple must be more frugal —
   swapping exotic holidays for caravanning and designer baby clothes for
   second hand — but Emily believes the benefits far outweigh any
   downsides.

   'Dan's a lot less stressed now he doesn't have to do a lot of the
   chores — though he does still take the bins out and he's a good cook —
   and I'm more supportive of him and his work,' says Emily. 'It's been
   good for our relationship.'

   While they may be reaping the benefits when it comes to their family
   life, this new breed of millennial housewife can find themselves
   criticised for wasting their education — or, worse, they become objects
   of pity.

   'There's a stigma about being a stay-at-home mum,' says Emily. 'When I
   used to say I worked at Innocent drinks, everyone knew the brand and
   they'd want to talk about what I did. When I didn't have that, I felt
   as though I'd lost my identity.'

   When 29-year-old Cathy Abrampah announced that she was giving up her
   £35,000-a-year job for the Financial Ombudsman to be a stay-at-home mum
   to one-year-old son Omari, her friends and family were staggered.

   'They were surprised, because I was extremely career-driven,' says
   Cathy, whose husband Kuma, also 29, is a financial adviser. 'But things
   change, people change.'

   Indeed, as women have children later — the average age of a first-time
   mother in the UK is now 28.6 — they are more likely to have already
   enjoyed career success, and so be happy to take a break.

   'Our generation is academic and so career-orientated, there's an
   expectation you'll get a high-powered job and not stay at home with a
   baby,' says Cathy, who lives in Essex in a four-bedroom house.

   'I'm not a feminist. I don't believe in it at all. I think we're trying
   to fix a way of living, of life and relationships, that wasn't broken.

   'I have friends who would describe themselves as feminists, but they
   are mostly single.'

   Cathy explains that her decision to be a stay-at-home mum was fuelled
   by a desire to recreate her own idyllic childhood, in which she and her
   five siblings were raised by their mother while her doctor father went
   out to work.

   'My mum stayed at home with us in our early years and she was so
   involved in our lives — on parent committees, always going to social
   events and baking for the cake sales — it meant she always noticed any
   changes in us.

   'When I fell pregnant, I knew I wanted to stay at home because I didn't
   think I could do my job well and be a good mother.'

   Kuma, who earns substantially more than his wife did, supported her
   decision, and Cathy believes their new arrangement has boosted their
   relationship on every level. 'It has improved our love life, because I
   have more energy now. We feel very close and we spend more time
   together,' says Cathy.

   She's not the only woman to find that leaving the boardroom — and
   adopting more traditionally 'womanly' tasks — can lead to greater
   satisfaction in the bedroom.
   Two years ago, Katie Meade, 30, gave up her job as a teacher in
   Hampshire ¿ and with it, her £22,000 salary ¿ to stay at home. She's
   pictured above with her husband Jason, and their children, Brooke, 22
   months, and 11-week-old Alfie

   pictured above with her husband Jason, and their children, Brooke, 22
   months, and 11-week-old Alfie

   A 2013 study found that when men did 'feminine' chores around the house
   — such as washing, cooking or vacuuming — couples had sex 1.5 fewer
   times a month than when men did traditionally 'masculine' jobs, such as
   mending the car or mowing the lawn.

   The women also reported greater sexual satisfaction if their husband
   performed more masculine tasks.

   However, being a stay-at-home mother is not without its downsides — not
   least the loss of financial independence that high-flying women take
   for granted.

   For women used to commanding a decent salary, having to ask their
   husband for 'pocket money' can feel demeaning.

   'It's the little things that bother me, like asking to get my nails or
   hair done or planning a night out with friends,' says Cathy. 'I manage
   all the bills and Kuma pays money into my account every month to cover
   them, and then the rest of the time I just use his debit card. While my
   husband always tells me it's our money, I don't always feel that way,
   as I'm not putting anything in the pot.'

   It's a situation with which 30-year-old Katie Meade, mum to Brooke, 22
   months, and 11-week-old Alfie, can sympathise. Two years ago, she gave
   up her job as a teacher in Hampshire — and with it, her £22,000 salary
   — to stay at home.

   'Fortunately, my husband Jason's career as a project manager has
   progressed and he's been given a pay rise, so there haven't been any
   real financial implications of me giving up work,' she says.

   Moreover, Katie believes that supporting the family financially has
   boosted her husband's ego. 'I think Jason feels proud that he's able to
   give us our lifestyle, and it makes him happy,' she says.

   Indeed, some experts claim that the shift back towards traditional
   gender roles — man as breadwinner, woman as homemaker — helps men feel
   . . . well . . . like men again.

   'Saying women should be the primary carers in the household may be a
   powerful way for young men to assert their masculinity, and for women
   to assert their support of traditional gender roles in a world in which
   the dominant economic role of men is no longer a given,' says political
   scientist Professor Dan Cassino.

   And just as Theresa May and her husband Philip claimed in an interview
   earlier this year that there were 'boy jobs and girl jobs', in Katie's
   home there are 'pink jobs and blue jobs'.
   I believe women are better at cleaning and keeping the house nice. If
   Jason vacuums, he won't do the edges of the room. He doesn't see what I
   see and I can't help pointing it out. I am a perfectionist. Things have
   to be my way.
                                                            - Katie Meade

   'The "pink jobs" are the female jobs — my jobs. I look after the
   children, do the laundry, organise our finances. Jason does the 'blue
   jobs': he takes out the bins, does DIY, hangs pictures on the wall,
   mows the lawn,' says Katie.

   'I believe women are better at cleaning and keeping the house nice. If
   Jason vacuums, he won't do the edges of the room. He doesn't see what I
   see and I can't help pointing it out. I am a perfectionist. Things have
   to be my way.'

   So why do utterly modern young women like Katie hold such old-fashioned
   views on marriage and family life?

   For many millennial women, the key lies in their own childhoods. Having
   watched their working mothers attempt the juggling act of 'having it
   all' — and seen them dropping a few balls in the process — they're
   reluctant even to try to combine motherhood with a demanding career.

   'My mum worked full-time when she had me and was head of the department
   by the time my brother and sister were born,' says Katie. 'We often had
   child-minders in the morning before school and after school, too,
   because of her hours.'

   Such arrangements are par for the course for the working mother — an
   expensive merry-go-round of childcare and stress that young women such
   as Katie, Cathy and Emily are in no hurry to leap on.

   Katie says: 'I found the idea that "you can have it all" to be a
   complete myth.'

   A former model who wants to be treated like a '1950s housewife' has
   revealed her exceedingly high standards while trying to find love.

   Claire Grey, 39, from Swansea, who was crowned Mrs Wales in the
   over-30s category last year, admitted to having an old fashioned
   attitude when it comes to domestic roles.

   She believes that women should stay at home while men go out to work -
   ensuring dinner is on the table for their husband every night and the
   household chores are taken care of.

   Alternatively, she thinks men should always pay for dinner, open the
   car door for her every single time and has even dumped one of her
   partners because they failed to hold her hand crossing the road.

   Speaking to the Mirror, she said: 'I'm like a 1950s housewife – I
   believe the man should work and the woman should look after the home.

   Psychotherapist Claire believes in antiquated dating rituals, revealing
   she wishes to be courted in the same way as characters from period
   dramas like Downton Abbey or Bridgerton.

   Considering herself the 'anti-feminist', she doesn't believe in one
   night stands and waits six months before sleeping with a man - adding
   that she believes 'women these days are easy'.

   She won't kiss on the first date - but admits her attitude towards
   intimacy can make it tough to find the right partner.

   When it comes to a first date, men should approach her house and knock
   on the door rather than texting to say they've arrived.

   She thinks men should always open the car door for her and must always
   pay on the date - even admitting she 'cringes' if she sees another
   woman paying at a restaurant or bar.

   While on a first date, Claire puts her suitors to the test by offering
   to buy the next round - but is horrified if they agree.

   In Claire's opinion men should not swear and should do the majority of
   the driving - however insists on her partner filling up her car with
   petrol if she does get behind the wheel.

   Claire's high standards include being showered with flowers and
   constantly being surprised with romantic gestures.

   When she eventually becomes a mother, Claire does not expect to have to
   work but believes that manners are more important than wealth when it
   comes to finding herself a partner.

   Chivalry is so important to Claire that she even claimed to have
   dumped an ex professional footballer after two months together because
   he forgot to hold her hand while on a romantic getaway to Paris.

The Housewife Theory of History

   Rebecca Solnit
   Photography by Bettman/CORBIS, used with permission

   ON THE WEST COAST OF MADAGASCAR, there’s a tribe called the Sakalava,
   who are theoretically monarchists, loyal to a line of male kings. Their
   loyalty, however, is to dead rather than living kings, and the wishes
   of the dead kings are made known through spirit mediums who are,
   according to David Graeber in his wonderful Fragments of an Anarchist
   Anthropology, “usually elderly women of common descent.” Which is to
   say that, officially, the Sakalava are governed by elite men, but
   ordinary elderly women are the literal voices of authority.

   I’m not sure we’re much different. We are governed mostly by elite men,
   quite a lot of them seemingly dead, and everything in our culture
   encourages us to regard these rulers not just as the central but the
   sole source of power. But history is changed again and again by people
   who are supposedly powerless, including the women veiled by the
   dismissive moniker housewife.

   When Kristen Breitweiser, Patty Casazza, Lorie Van Auken, and Mindy
   Kleinberg, widows of men killed in the attacks on the World Trade
   Center, started doing research and demanding answers from elected
   representatives, they gave rise to the 9/11 Commission. Nicknamed the
   Jersey Girls, they became experts on national security and terrorism. A
   year after the towers collapsed, one of them spoke forcefully to
   Congress about what had really happened. A year and a half after that,
   the 9/11 Commission issued the official verdict that there were no ties
   between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. By that time, the Jersey Girls
   were campaigning against Bush’s re-election.

   They didn’t win that one, but they won’t go away, any more than the
   Seattle-area mothers of mentally disabled children did when they ran
   into roadblock after roadblock to getting their children public school
   educations and other basic rights. Those three mothers, Evelyn Chapman,
   Katie Dolan, and Jane Taggart, went, as my friend Susan Schwartzenberg
   says in her forthcoming book, Becoming Citizens: Family Life and the
   Politics of Disability, “from outraged mothers to sophisticated
   activists utilizing a well-honed network of politicians, labor leaders,
   legislators, judges and the media.” In 1971, Washington State passed
   the law that paved the way for the national Education for All Act of
   1975, renamed the IDEA — Individuals with Disabilities Education Act —
   in 1990.

   I think of Lois Gibbs in Love Canal in upstate New York, who started
   investigating the rash of illnesses in her working-class neighborhood,
   founded the Love Canal Homeowners Association in 1978, and continued
   connecting the dots and fighting the power until she became a founding
   figure in the environmental justice movement. Today she is director of
   the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice, helping people find
   the voice to oppose their own destruction and fighting to reduce human
   exposure to poisons like dioxin. Her work helped generate the
   Environmental Protection Agency. I think of Las Madres de Este Los
   Angeles, who succeeded in keeping a succession of toxic dumps,
   incinerators, and a chemical treatment plant out of their East L.A.
   neighborhood in the 1980s and 1990s.

   I think of Women Strike for Peace, who faced down anticommunist
   authorities at the height of the Cold War to protest the nuclear arms
   race, nuclear weapons, and the nuclear testing that was causing
   catastrophic damage to the environment and human health — particularly
   that of infants and children. They started in November of 1961 with a
   one-day strike in the mode of Lysistrata, more than a hundred thousand
   of them in cities across the country leaving their homes to stand up
   against arms and war. The members of WSP subversively used their gender
   and their genteel, housewifely image to suggest that being against what
   the government was doing wasn’t radical but sensible, motherly, and
   kindhearted.

   This might be the secret of the housewife theory of history: These
   women take the qualities that are supposed to render them irrelevant
   and use them defiantly as well as strategically. Starting with what
   they love, they cut straight through the quicksand of motives and
   purposes to point out that harm has been done and should be stopped. In
   some sense, they depoliticize politics, which is what makes them so
   politically potent. When asked whether they were in cahoots with the
   Soviets, WSP activists said that they thought perhaps Soviet mothers
   didn’t want their children afflicted by fallout either.

   Women Strike for Peace achieved two signal victories. One was their
   contribution to the end of aboveground nuclear testing with the Limited
   Test Ban Treaty of 1963, a huge step forward in limiting the arms race
   and its environmental damage. The other was the decline and fall of the
   House Un-American Activities Committee, the Homeland Security Grand
   Inquisition of its day. When interrogated, the WSP women on trial so
   mocked and exposed the heavy-handed fearmongering of the HUAC that they
   helped to destroy it, making possible far freer political expression.
   They opposed the Vietnam War early on. And so the 60s, that era often
   associated with young men, was jump-started by women who used hats and
   gloves and baby carriages as part of their arsenal.

   You could go farther afield to Buenos Aires, where the Mothers of the
   Plaza de Mayo became the most fearless and visible opposition to a
   terrifying regime by organizing women across Argentina and contacting
   international human rights organizations. They still walk in protest in
   the Plaza de Mayo, the center of the nation, every week. They used
   their status as mothers to reject the definitions the government
   offered for those who had been “disappeared”: These were not
   terrorists, they were beloved children who could not be erased. You
   could look to the women of the Niger Delta, who since 1986 have
   repeatedly shut down Shell and Chevron’s oil facilities. But even here
   at home the history is clear: the 9/11 Commission, the EPA, the Limited
   Test Ban Treaty, the Education for All Act. That’s a radically
   different landscape than we might have occupied had these activists not
   stood up for themselves and their clan.

   The typical cinematic consequence of personal injury is the outraged
   paterfamilias avenging his family with a gun, a role played by Charles
   Bronson, Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood, and George Bush. These killers
   don’t pursue principles or seek to prevent further harm; instead they
   inflict it in revenge. Silkwood and Erin Brockovich are anomalies. They
   illustrate how the housewife-become-activist shifts from defending her
   own tribe to defending the principle that everyone should be free from
   fallout or dioxin, that everyone should have an education or know the
   truth about what the government is doing. She fights not for revenge,
   but for rights. The community she develops generates organizations,
   legislation, laws, education, and awareness. It’s a saga of expanding
   connections, while the killer heroes in the movies remain strikingly
   isolated. One of the problems for unions and organizers in America is
   that our dominant stories about how the world gets changed feature lone
   heroes, not collectives and associations. The unsung builders of those
   associations make a shift from the personal and local to the national
   and the principle, which becomes the only way to continue taking care.

   The Greek word oikos, meaning house, is the root of the word ecologist,
   which could be defined as, among other things, housewife. It’s not that
   I’m so fixated on housewives, who are one among many categories of
   individual that have taken power to change the world, and it’s not that
   I believe that the category housewife is so compelling a definition of
   women who have other lives before and after and often during staying
   home with kids. It’s that, just as the Sakalava are officially ruled by
   kings while elderly commoner women do the talking, so are we officially
   rescued by action-hero loners while others do the real work of
   organizing to save the world (from, among other things, action-hero
   loners).

   Rebecca Solnit’s father was a pretty good urban planner, but it was her
   mother who did volunteer work for fair-housing rights during the Civil
   Rights era. Solnit’s latest book is A Field Guide to Getting Lost.

   A woman has sparked an online debate after saying stay at home wives
   and mothers are often the target of vitriol - prompting some to say
   they would be 'devastated' if their offspring chose not to work.

   The anonymous, UK-based poster took to parenting forum Mumsnet to
   garner opinions on the divisive topic by sharing a post titled [Am I
   being unreasonable] to not understand the nastiness that being a
   housewife provokes.

   She wrote: 'Not just on Mumsnet. I don't even use Mumsnet that often
   but I see this on other social media websites too.

   'If a woman shares something positive about being a housewife it's full
   of comments about how "being controlled by a man, couldn't be me!" "No
   thanks, I love my independence" or "just wait until he leaves you, then
   what".

   The poster noted that she was curious about attitudes towards both stay
   at home mothers and wives, despite many having different feelings about
   those who stay home without children to care for

   'If a woman shares something negative about it its "see, this is why
   being a housewife is TERRIBLE" (yet no one would say "this is why
   having a career is terrible!" If a person was complaining about their
   job).

   'I saw someone earlier say they'd be devastated if their daughter
   wanted to be a stay-at-home mother.

   'Why does it provoke such vitriol? Other women choosing this doesn't
   force anyone else to, I don't get the complete lack of respect for
   people's decisions and lack of understanding that different people
   enjoy different things.'

   The post sparked a mixed response, with a number of forum users
   questioning the assertion that stay-at-home women and mothers are the
   recipients of such vitriol, with some noting that working mothers are
   also criticised.

   Several forum users questioned whether stay at home wives and mothers
   are subject to such vitriol, while others suggested women face
   judgement whatever their choices

   One wrote: 'Who is being nasty? There are more posts complaining about
   the nastiness than the nasty posts themselves?'

   Another added: 'I have mainly been a SAHP/housewife for the last 25
   years and have never received any funny comments from people. My DH was
   fortunate to be able to retire at 55 and now neither of us work.'

   And a third said: 'I haven’t seen much of that - and what there is is
   counterbalanced by the ‘oh it’s so awful to put your kids in nursery’
   stuff. lots of people are SAHM at least for a couple years so it can’t
   be seen as that peculiar.'

   However, some agreed, suggested that the poster was right, and that
   those who stay at home - either as wives or parents - often are
   criticised.

   Several posters suggested that people criticise the idea of being a
   housewife or stay at home mother because they are jealous

   One wrote: 'I have no idea why people can be nasty about SAHMs and
   housewives either.

   'Theres probably lots of reasons. Maybe jealousy about not having the
   choice, maybe a lack of trust in men in general (e.g. if youve been
   previously cheated on, or product of separated parents etc), maybe
   having worked hard to get to a certain place at work and not
   understanding how anyone might decide to give that up for
   kids/housework etc.'

   Another said: 'Apparently I'm both a terrible person and a victim for
   being a housewife/SAHM. I do everything for my husband including laying
   out his clothes in the morning and preparing all his meals. He rarely
   cooks or cleans but has a list of jobs I can't do that he does. But
   apparently I'm being abused by him. I chose and still choose this life!
   And I get to spend his money in return.

   'I find the people most upset are usually the bitter ones who want to
   be traditional but can't/won't.'

   And a third simply said: 'It's jealousy (but they’ll never admit
   it).'

   A number of respondents admitted they would be devastated if their
   offspring chose not to work, and instead be dependent on a partner

   Others suggested that a lot of negativity around women staying at home
   was likely to be coming from a place of concern around such people
   being reliant on their partners, and missing out on the potential
   fulfilment of working.

   One admitted: 'I voted that you are not being unreasonable, but I would
   be devastated if my daughter wanted to be a housewife. Kids are young
   for such a short time and e benefit from socialization. In addition,
   work can be so satisfying and affirming. I was able to work part-time
   when my kids were little and then full-time. My husband was a high
   earner and he left me after 16 years of marriage. I think I would have
   died if I did not have the support, routine, and continuity of work,
   never mind the pension it allowed me to save. In the modem world sahm
   make themselves extremely vulnerable.'

   Another added: 'The way you're describing it is over the top and I
   agree each to their own but I agree with the poster who said she'd be
   devastated if her daughter chose that path. It's a path I would never
   consider for myself either. Only because living on someone else's whim
   fills me with dread.'

   And a third wrote: 'If my kids remain healthy, I would hate for them to
   be financially dependent on a partner. I hope neither my son nor
   daughter end up as sahps. I also think it’s a sexist construct as there
   are still way more sahms than sahds. It contributes to the gender pay
   gap and inequality which I hate. It’s a hugely vulnerable position in
   the long term, however much protection people think they have put in
   place.

   'On an individual basis, I get why some people end up having to choose
   the sah role. And I love my sahm friends as much as those who work. My
   opposition to the sahm role is nothing personal.'

   An Australian wife has been attacked by trolls after revealing she
   cooks three meals a day for her husband.

   Sonali Arora started posting videos to TikTok of the meals she makes
   for her husband, Nipun, but was met with backlash from people calling
   her a '1950s housewife' who was 'destroying feminism and women's
   liberation'.

   'If it's not people coming for the portion sizes, it's them attacking
   my husband without even knowing him, calling him a two-year-old, people
   saying that he's misogynistic or I am in the 1950s,' she told FEMAIL.

   The Melbourne newlyweds split the housework '50/50' with Sonali
   enjoying cooking so much she started posting recipes and Nipun's
   lunchboxes to TikTok, however, the abuse soon started flowing.

   'This is satire right?' one viewer asked while another said: 'I don't
   think I have ever packed a lunch for my husband, not his mother'.

   'Being proud of this is my worst nightmare. As they say - Being
   master's favourite dog is still having a master and being a dog,' a
   third harshly replied.

   'Ever heard of the saying 'making a rod for your own back?',' wrote a
   fourth.

   The 26-year-old said while she tries not to let the mean comments get
   to her she's had to delete many hurtful replies.

   'You get a bit defensive about the person you love and especially when
   they're being picked on in the wrong light,' she said.

   Sonali said the assumptions that Nipun is immature or misogynistic
   couldn't be further from the truth and the pair split all the housework
   '50/50'

   'Even though I know they're just complete strangers and what they say
   doesn't define anything, it does still hurt to see.'

   Sonali said the assumptions the online trolls make about their
   relationship couldn't be further from the truth.

   'My husband is the sweetest and most supportive and least misogynistic
   person to ever be on this planet,' she said.

   'We have a really good thing going, we divide all the house chores.
   After I cook he's cleaning dishes, I don't touch that. He also is
   responsible for cleaning all the bathrooms and vacuuming the floors.'

   Sonali, who works in cyber security, said she is very independent and
   career driven and would not have the time to whip up three delicious
   meals a day for Nipun if she wasn't working from home.

   'Cooking is something that I love, that's my love language and
   something that brings me joy. It makes me even happier when I see his
   reaction to the creations that I've put together,' she said

   'Cooking is something that I love, that's my love language and

   reaction to the creations that I've put together,' she said

   'That's what gives me the flexibility to cook him three meals a day. If
   I didn't work from home, it definitely would not be that way at all,'
   she said.

   'Cooking is something that I love, that's my love language and

   Despite the hate, Sonali said she receives just as many, if not more,
   positive responses to her videos and refuses to let the haters stop her
   from sharing her passion.

   'Hell yeah, I'm going to keep posting them! It actually helps a lot of
   people in getting diverse ideas for what they can make throughout the
   day because it is such a difficult thing to think about,' she said.

   'It's nice that I've tapped in this community of people who are food
   lovers.'

Not Just a Housewife

   In this week's Spot, Sadhguru posts an excerpt from a recent "In
   Conversation" with Juhi Chawla on the question of motherhood and
   career. Sadhguru says, "I have asked many ladies, 'What are you doing?'
   They say, “'Oh, I am just a housewife...' They do not seem to
   understand the significance of being able to nurture two or three new
   lives." Sadhguru describes the responsibility and beauty of being a
   mother, and about whether mothers should also have a career. Enjoy!

   On the occasion of the anniversary of Sadhguru’s enlightenment,
   Sadhguru writes, "I bow to Chamundeshwari, for at her feet I attained
   to grace, though unintended. On this day, my special blessings to all."
   -Sadhguru

   Below is an excerpt from In Conversation with the Mystic, Juhi Chawla
   with Sadhguru on "Love and Life."

   Juhi Chawla: Today, many women in our modern society are stepping out
   and having a career. What do you think about women having a career,
   managing a home and being financially independent?

   Sadhguru: Every woman should do what she wants to do as an individual.
   It should not be made into a trend in society or be the only right
   thing to do in the world. I think that if a woman intends to have two
   children and raise them, it is a full time job.  I am not saying she
   should not go out and work. If she wishes to, as an individual, she is
   free to do what she wants. But having two children is not about
   reproduction. You are manufacturing the next generation of people. How
   the world will be tomorrow will be determined by what kind of mothers
   you have today.

   I have asked many ladies, “What are you doing?” They say, “Oh, I am
   just a housewife.” I say, “Why do you say, you are just a housewife?”
   They do not seem to understand the significance of being able to
   nurture two or three new lives. It is a very important job. My mother
   never went about telling me, “I love you” or anything of this kind. It
   is just that she simply lived; it never occurred to us whether she
   loved us or not. Such questions never came because her whole life was
   dedicated to us. We know she lived for us. And I cannot imagine that
   part of my life without her being around.

   My mother never played an active role in what I am, but without the
   ambience that she set for me¸ I would never be what I am. She gave her
   life to set that ambience, knowing fully well it will play out
   somewhere. That has been the most important thing she did for me. Why
   would anybody think this is not an important job? In early life, we
   never had to think about anything. She simply made sure the background
   was always there. We lived unconcerned about what was happening around
   us; this is what gave me the possibility of sitting with my eyes closed
   for days on end.

   Right now, we have made the whole world into economics. Money is just
   procurement of things that you need. Men were procuring and women were
   talking about the more beautiful aspects of life. Now, women also want
   to procure. If there is such an economic need in the family – fine, she
   must do it -- but it must not be set up as something better to do. If
   she sings, plays music or cooks -- or if she just loves her children --
   she lives beautifully, like a flower. It is good enough.

   It should not be that a woman is only doing something valuable if she
   earns money. If there is an economic need, or if she has a passion for
   it, she can do it. But let us not set up such values in the world.
   Society would not be evolving; it would be regressing by making
   survival more important than the aesthetics of life.

To be or not to be a housewife – the modern Asian woman’s dilemma

     * Vivian Vivian

   [014-singapore.svg]
   December 21, 2013

In this article

   There is this one scene from secondary school that has stayed with me
   until today.

   One day in a Chinese language class, the teacher asked us a question.
   Actually the question was directed to the boys.

   ‘How many of you would prefer their wife to be a housewife?’

   And to my surprise (and at the time, indignation) almost all of the
   boys in my class raised their hands. For someone like me who was
   brought up in a dual income household and naturally thought women are
   equal to and have the same rights as men, it was a pretty jarring
   moment.

   I couldn’t imagine not having a career.

   The thing is, now that I’m older and have seen more of the world, I
   find myself asking, ‘Is it possible that I will become a housewife for
   2-3 years when I start having children?’. The thought ‘Would that be so
   bad?’ crossed my mind too.

   Screen Shot 2013-12-19 at 6.04.48 PM

   As those 15 year old boys thought, our society is still very much
   deferent to men, where the man is the breadwinner and the woman takes
   care of the family. So many of my girl friends (who studied 5 years in
   university for a professional degree) have put a hold on their careers
   to have babies.

   But have you ever heard of a man taking some time out from their
   careers to raise children? Simply unimaginable.

   For the modern Asian woman, not only does she have a full time career,
   but due to the way nature works, she still has to carry the babies to
   term, and due to societal and cultural conditioning, performs the
   majority of the child rearing. And it seems to me that the ladies don’t
   really mind taking up more of the duties where childcare is concerned.
   In fact they seem to want to.

   If you’re South Korean, female and ambitious, one of the most sought
   after dreams is to become a flight stewardess. 20,000 women apply every
   year, including top graduates from some universities, but only 150 get
   the job. Why a flight stewardess? Because it pays well, has flexible
   hours, and perhaps most importantly, is the pathway to a good marriage.
   Apparently after 5 years most of them quit to get married.

   Asian women are also underrepresented at every level of top management
   in Asia. Compared to our Western counterparts, we Asians seem less
   ambitious. Is it because of the pressure of traditional societal
   expectations that force us to put family first and career
   later?enablejsapi=1&amp;html5=1&amp; Or is it that we actually feel that we
   want to stay home and cultural norm just makes it easier for us to make
   that decision?

   For me personally, it’s been a revelation, but I’ve had quite a change
   of heart from my 15 year old self. I feel like I’m not as ambitious as
   I was back then, and I really wouldn’t mind taking a few years off to
   focus on raising children. Whether this is purely psychological from
   seeing a lot of people I know setting up families, or is it a
   consequence of the innate hormone releasing biological clock that
   compels women to have children before their fertility wanes, I still
   have no idea.

   However, one thing that those teenage boys didn’t take into account was
   the rising cost of living.  As this article by The Edge Malaysia put
   it, the dual income household has become indispensable if you want to
   have children, especially if you’re solidly middle class. So whether or
   not we can afford to have one parent not working for awhile has become
   a big issue.

   So therein lies a some of the dilemmas of the modern woman: we want and
   need to spend to more time with the family, but we also we need the
   income from our careers, and between it all if we’re lucky, we think
   about some career building.

   As Anne-Marie Slaughter put it in her highly viral article for The
   Atlantic, unless you’re superhuman, rich or self employed, women still
   can’t have it all.

   And perhaps for a lot of Asian women living in Asia, they don’t want it
   all in the first place.

   This is part of our Vulcan Post Saturday Column, where we write about
   thought that matters.

'R54 800 per month': Kenyan judge declares that being a housewife is a
full-time job worthy of compensation

   "Raising children is a full-time job that families pay a person to
   do..."

   A Kenyan high court judge has declared that being a housewife is a
   full-time job, and it should therefore attract some form of
   compensation.

   While presiding over a matrimonial dispute, Teresia Matheka, who is a
   Kenyan High Court Judge, said that it is unfair for courts to deny the
   contribution that housewives provide to the financial progress of the
   household.

   Though the exact details pertaining to the financial remuneration have
   not been officially finalised, the High Court ruled on 24 September
   2021 that a housewife should be paid a salary every month.

   'No less' than R54 800 per month

   The complainant in the respective judiciary matter was a divorced
   housewife who sought to have the family property sold and the
   reparations split equally between herself and her ex-husband.

   "It is easy for the spouse working away from home and sending money to
   lay claim to the whole property purchased and developed with that money
   by the spouse staying at home and taking care of the children and the
   family. That spouse will be heard to say that the other one was not
   employed so they contributed nothing," said Judge Matheka.

   Judge Matheka maintained that the services provided by a housewife
   should be considered work, as those tasks would otherwise be outsourced
   and paid for and stated that it would be unfair to constitute only
   monetary contributions to the household as valuable.

   In passing judgement on the matter, Judge Matheka ruled that the
   property be sold and the money shared equally, or that one spouse
   should buy out the other party by paying half the value of the property
   to the entitled party.

   'Pregnancy is equivalent to working'

   In addition to considering the value of the services rendered by a
   housewife, Judge Matheka urged her counterparts to consider the nine
   months of pregnancy when presiding over matrimonial matters, as she
   believes that pregnancy is equivalent to working, given that surrogates
   are hired and paid to bear children.

   On a Kenyan radio station, Kiss FM, presenter Kamene Goro weighed in on
   the matter on her morning show, stating that Kenyan housewives deserve
   no less than 400 000 Kenyan shillings as monthly compensation. This
   equates to approximately R54 800 per month.
   To drive her point home, Kamene shared that her previous marriage was a
   "tiresome experience", saying: "It's like a full-time job."

   "Raising children is a full-time job that families pay a person to do.
   Cooking and cleaning as well. Hence, for a woman in employment who has
   to balance childbearing and rearing this contribution must be
   considered," said Judge Matheka.

   know about spousal maintenance

   A monthly allowance for South African housewives?

   In South Africa, a housewife is not legally entitled to be compensated
   for services rendered, however, a court will take various factors into
   account to determine if a spouse is entitled to spousal maintenance
   after a divorce or separation.

   Spousal maintenance is the legal obligation on a person to provide
   financial support to his or her spouse before or after marital
   separation or divorce.
   The court has wide discretion when considering maintenance claims but
   ideally, spousal maintenance should enable you to maintain the same
   standard of living as during the marriage.

   Do you believe that this ruling could influence South African law one
   day, and become applicable here? Share your comments and questions via

Marching On: A Review of “Little Women” at First Folio Theatre

   As a social barometer, Louisa May Alcott’s mid-nineteenth-century
   coming-of-age novel, “Little Women,” holds up. Although performed often
   as a play, the ostensible equality of women to men in modern-day
   society justifies every recurrence.

   The most recent iteration of “Little Women” to hit the Chicago area is
   presented by First Folio Theatre at the Mayslake Peabody Estate in Oak
   Brook. After twenty-six years, founding executive director David Rice
   is retiring and closing the company, making “Little Women” the
   third-to-last production of the final season.

   The lives of the four March sisters are framed by dark mahogany wood
   beams and numerous nooks filled to bursting with books in a spacious
   attic. Jo (Shelby Lynn Bias) is independent, a voracious reader and
   aspiring writer. Oldest sister Meg (Stephanie Fongheiser) is Jo’s
   near-opposite, content to marry and become a housewife. Third-oldest
   Beth (Jamie Herb) resembles a Dickensian heroine—subdued, angelic,
   trying to please everyone—too good for this world. The youngest sister,
   Amy (Esther Fishbein), is a brat, who grows to become a mature-ish
   artist.

   Each personality trait is amplified to the maximum, making the girls
   appear more childish than their ages—Amy, who should be twelve years
   old, comes across as seven or eight, a developmental drop that afflicts
   all characters. But the chemistry feels right, and interactions, though
   highly animated, come off as genuine and heartfelt.

   “Little Women”/Photo: Tom McGrath

   The actors perform double duty, with everyone except Bias playing both
   a sister and a male love interest. Fishbein briefly steps into the
   shoes of Meg’s future husband, John Brooke, and Fongheiser manages a
   German-ish accent as Professor Bhaer.

   Herb plays Laurie, Jo’s eager, wide-eyed childhood boyfriend, who
   not-so-secretly pines for her throughout their friendship. Among fans
   there is an ongoing debate whether Jo should have married Laurie or
   not. This production is unambiguous in asserting that Jo would never
   have been happy with such an immature and whiny partner, and why she
   winds up falling for the older Professor Bhaer.

   Two visual metaphors are used to great effect. While in Paris, Amy uses
   inflatable red balloons to symbolize her art, releasing every work she
   deems not a masterpiece to be sent squealing and twisting through the
   air. In the most brilliant scene in the production, new housewife Meg
   loses her mind while attempting to make currant jam, with lightweight
   juggling scarves representing how many things she has “up in the air.”

   Director Melanie Keller moves the show along at a quick pace that keeps
   the viewer enthralled. The adaptation, written by Heather Chrisler,
   contains a few big twists that Alcott would approve of.

   Today, the phrase “what is a woman” is a slur used by men on television
   and in politics to denigrate others. The women in “Little Women,”
   defined so clearly in First Folio Theatre’s recent production, show
   that womanhood exists on a spectrum. It’s sad that we—mostly men—need
   this reminder, but that is why works like this are so important, and
   why performers and audiences return to them again and again.

   “Little Women” at First Folio Theatre Company at Mayslake Peabody
   Estate, 1717 31st Street in Oak Brook, firstfolio.org, (630)986-8067.
   Tickets are $49-$59 with discounts for seniors and students.

Victim’s parents to receive pension for life

   Peace of mind: Housewife Norhayani Abdul Ghani, 41, doing chores at her
   home in Petaling Jaya. Housewives like her will have better protection
   under the social security scheme. — AZMAN GHANI/The Star

   PETALING JAYA: A new social security scheme for women has been
   welcomed, especially by those who cannot afford to buy personal
   insurance coverage.

   Housewife Visithra Alagan, 42, said that she is looking forward to
   being a part of the Housewives Social Security Scheme (SKSSR) due to
   its affordability.

   “As a B40 family, it is very difficult for us to buy a personal
   insurance policy and pay for it every month as it could be very
   expensive.

   “With this scheme’s one-time payment of RM120 for a whole year, I think
   my husband could easily afford it,” she added.

   Visithra emphasised the importance of the scheme for women like
   herself.

   “I have been injured several times at home, including once when my hand
   was sprained badly while cleaning and I couldn’t go to the doctor due
   to financial constraints.

   “With this scheme, however, I think that many women, particularly
   widows and single mothers who have been injured doing household chores
   and cannot afford treatment due to the high cost, will be able to
   obtain protection,” she said.

   Maimunah Mustapa, 49, said although she does not have full details of
   the scheme, she was eager to register for it, given how she spent much
   of her time alone at home.“I was unaware of it at first, but now that I
   have heard about it, I am curious to learn more because I think it
   would be very beneficial for me.

   “My children live in different states, and my husband works out of town
   frequently, so if anything were to happen, it’s good to know that there
   is a scheme to protect me,” said the housewife.

   Under the SKSSR, husbands can choose to pay the contribution for their
   wives, which amounts to RM120, to the Social Security Organisation
   (Socso) to be protected for 12 months.

   A business manager who only identified herself as Chong said having the
   scheme in place would allow her to carry out household chores with
   peace of mind.

   “Initially, I thought only housewives would benefit from this but
   knowing that working women are also eligible, I am interested in
   registering.

   “It also adds another layer of security for me, seeing how I already
   have personal insurance as well,” said the mother of two.

   Academic assistant K. John, 33, is considering registering his mother
   under the scheme.

   “My mother is active at work and at home.

   “She takes care of the family and enrolling in this scheme would ensure
   she is protected while carrying out household chores,” he said.

Kuala Lumpur oil and gas exec claims trial to 43 counts of graft

Housewife charged with operating illegal dental clinic
       Sabah &amp; Sarawak 29 Dec 2022

Bersatu asks Dewan Rakyat Speaker to vacate four seats under GRS

   KUALA LUMPUR: The insurance protection scheme for housewives will be
   available from Dec 1, says Datuk Seri M. Saravanan.

   The Human Resources Minister said the scheme to cover homemakers
   against injuries suffered while tending to their chores would be
   managed by the Social Security Organisation (Socso).

   For now, it only provides coverage for housewives, he added.

   ‘’I call on all husbands and fathers to come forward, sign up and start
   contributing. This is to show their love and that they care,’’ he said
   in a press conference here yesterday.

   On July 26, the Dewan Rakyat passed the Housewives Social Security Bill
   (HSS), which allows husbands to voluntarily contribute to the scheme
   for their wives below the age of 55.

   The scheme offers insurance coverage of between RM300 and RM50,000,
   depending on the seriousness of the injuries sustained.

   Asked if the definition of housewife would be widened to cover husbands
   who assume the role of homemakers as well, Saravanan said the ministry
   would need an in-depth study to see the number of house husbands
   involved.

   “If the need arises, the ministry has no problem to extend the coverage
   for male homemakers too,’’ he said.

   Saravanan said the HSS scheme is voluntary and husbands are not
   compelled to make contributions for their wives.

   “No action would be taken against any husband who did not contribute.”

   However, he noted that husbands who have signed up to contribute and
   failed to maintain it monthly would be fined RM10,000.

   “Those who have signed up and face problems to contribute later on can
   discuss or file an application with Socso.

   “For example, maybe they have lost their source of income or a divorce
   took place, then they can come forward within 60 days to be exempted,”
   he said.

   Saravanan also said the amendments passed in the Employment Insurance
   System Act 2017 (Act 800) and Employees’ Social Security Act 1969 (Act
   4) to increase the maximum monthly salary ceiling limit from RM4,000 to
   RM5,000 would come into effect next month.

   “This will improve social security coverage and workers’ protection,”
   he said, adding that a worker’s highest and lowest contribution was RM7
   and 70 sen a month.

   With the ceiling limit not changed since 2016, he said these amendments
   would see workers receiving wider protection and benefits, especially
   when the cost of living has gone up.

   The increase would involve, among others, temporary disability
   benefits, permanent disability benefits, disability pensions and
   retirement pensions.

Teenage housewife throws stepson inside well in Katsina

   Published

   on
   November 20, 2022

   By
   Amos Tauna

   Maryam Habibu, an 18-year-old housewife, has been arrested by the
   police in Katsina State for allegedly drowning her four-year-old
   stepson in a well in the Kafur Local Government Area of the state.

   Habibu, who is from Leko village in the Danja Local Government Area
   was, alongside 11 other suspects held for various offences, ranging
   from banditry, kidnapping to cattle rustling, paraded on Friday at the
   Police Command Headquarters, Katsina.

   SP Gambo Isah, the command’s spokesman, while briefing newsmen during
   the parade, explained that the teenage housewife was arrested on
   November 9, 2022.

   He further explained that she allegedly lured the boy out and threw him
   inside a well.

   According to the PPRO, Habibu and the victim’s father were an estranged
   couple.

   Habibu, who spoke to newsmen in Hausa, admitted to the crime, saying it
   was destiny at play.

   According to her, “It’s true I threw the boy inside the well where he
   died but it has been destined that he would die on that day. That is
   why he died.”

   We all know about the glamorous lifestyle that Dubai has and it shows
   clearly on social media, TikToks and Youtube videos as well. Recently,
   lionlindaa posted a TikTok that showed her life as a 23-year-old
   housewife living in Dubai.

   She starts off the video buying a luxurious pair of heels from Saint
   Laurent Paris. It took her quite a while to get her hands on this as
   her size wasn’t available.

   Then the lady says, “I went to Valentino and I tried on these shoes but
   they were too much of like a grandma. But then I got this clearance
   vial of oil and then I was invited to a really special jewelry showing
   in the Dubai Mall.”

   Now talking about Jewelry and Dubai we all know everything is expensive
   and she wanted to buy all of them because they were “so pretty”. Her
   favouritie of them costed “$300,000”.

   Then her husband came and they went to Balenciaga and after then to
   Tulum.

   The lady describes it as the best Mexican food I’ve ever had in Dubai.
   It was actually really good.

   Then we can see her husband kissing her hand because she is mad at him.
   He only bought her 2 diamond necklaces instead of four and that’s it.

   Watch the video here:

     How could he do that to me😭 #dubai #housewife #rhobh

   Most viewers in the comment didn’t understand her satire in the video
   and its description. One of them wrote, “At least you get 2 😅” while
   another commented, “He only got me 2 necklaces instead of 4. And I’m
   over here struggling to buy my one year old new clothes.”

   Its funny how some of them were even giving her advice. Tatum wrote, “I
   don’t get why ppl have to buy name brand things. I mean it’s just
   clothes..u could find the same style cheaper. The only difference is
   the name..”

Whatever happened to the housewife?

   It started 40 years ago, when a letter to this paper led to a register
   of all those bored women stuck at home in suburbia. And now?


   Raekha Prasad

   It was with sharp frustration and a dollop of sympathy that Guardian
   journalist Betty Jerman wrote about surburbia 40 years ago. The open
   space and fresh air, she said, made it a good place to bring up
   children, but she feared these advantages were outweighed by the
   brain-numbing atmosphere.

   "Surburbia is an incredibly dull place to live in and I blame the
   women," she wrote. "They stay here all day. They set the tone. Many of
   them look back with regret to the days when they worked in an office.
   Their work kept them alert. Home and childminding can have a blunting
   effect on a woman's mind. But only she can sharpen it."

   Jerman's observations struck a chord with reader Maureen Nicol. She
   wrote to the paper suggesting that "housebound wives with liberal
   interests and a desire to remain individuals could form a national
   register, so that whenever one moves, one can contact like-minded
   friends".

   An avalanche of letters was sent to the paper from desperate women all
   over the country who felt they were floundering in what society
   expected of them as wives and mothers. Women who had been educated but,
   like their mothers before them, found themselves trapped in the
   domestic sphere, often having to up sticks because of their husband's
   job, even if they'd found a kindred spirit nearby.

   Local groups formed and a few years later acquired the name the
   National Housewives' Register. In the absence of a personal income,
   early members admit fiddling the housekeeping to raise the small
   membership fee. Today most groups meet every other week to discuss
   everything except the domestic, with debates on current affairs, book
   groups and speakers invited from every public sphere.

   Year on year membership grew until, in 1980, it peaked at 24,000. This
   enthusiasm proved Virginia Woolf right when, in A Room Of One's Own,
   she wrote: "Women have sat indoors all these millions of years, so that
   by this time the very walls are permeated by their creative force,
   which has, indeed, so overcharged the capacity of bricks and mortar
   that it must needs harness itself to pens and brushes and business and
   politics." Numbers have been falling since the 80s; today 8,000 women
   are members of what has been known since 1987 as the National Women's
   Register.

   The change of title raises the question of the organisation's future.
   The oldest member is 92 and though there are members in their late 20s,
   this generation of women is by no means rushing to join. NWR may be
   celebrating its ruby anniversary but will an organisation born to
   alleviate the lot of the housewife survive to drink to its golden when,
   politically and personally, she is apparently dead and buried? Imagine
   the outcry if Tony Blair made an example of the housewife's foresight
   in the way Margaret Thatcher once did. The title has been banished to
   the social history archives and now rears its head only in the
   unreconstructed genres of TV quiz shows and market research
   questionnaires.

   The spic 'n' span 50s feather duster image of the British housewife
   went out with Hilda Ogden and Ken Dodd. Instead, the debate about women
   and domesticity has evolved into an anxiety not about keeping house but
   about bringing up children. So whereas it was better for "him" for a
   woman to stay at home, the argument now is it's best for the kids. The
   observation Jerman made about the mental "pay-off' a housewife makes
   still has echoes. What's best for the children may not be what's best
   for the modern woman. The lack of status implied by the prefix "just" a
   housewife has not died with the term but now attaches itself to the
   word mother.

   "Working mother" now rolls off the tongue with the ease with which
   "housewife" once did. These women no longer go into voluntary exile if
   they marry or have children but, argues Mary Dodkins, NWR's marketing
   co-ordinator, there is still a need for a space where you are not
   someone's wife or mother, a place where you can be opinionated without
   fear of the consequences. Today, most members work, so the rules have
   been extended - no discussion about the domestic still stands but their
   jobs are now an out-of-bounds subject.

   "The purpose of the meetings is still to stimulate the grey cells,"
   Dodkins says. "Many women feel limited by their job and position. It is
   not a place where they feel their real thoughts can be said, so the
   more controversial the discussions are, the better."

   For Kathryn de Motte, at 37 the youngest area organiser of a 30-strong
   NWR group in Nottingham, the emphasis on speaking your mind is crucial.
   She works as a secretary and finds herself having opinions she says she
   wouldn't articulate anywhere else."We all have different hats," she
   explains. "I'm a mother, I'm a wife and I work, and there's never a
   space to be me. We get together not to exercise or diet but to open our
   minds."

   De Motte speaks enthusiastically about the subjects to which the
   speakers and discussions have introduced her: badgers, local history
   and learning how to juggle at the lighter end; Kafka, fox-hunting and
   infant mortality rates at the more serious.

   But as women juggle the domestic with work, is there a need for the
   NWR? "It's still important to be with like-minded women," de Motte
   says. "Women still have more pressures than men. In my husband's life,
   his strongest role is in his job, but I have that and the role of wife
   and mother. We need a space to be just us - without the children." Time
   at home, alone, without chores, is still often felt as shirking
   responsibility. De Motte, for example, won't attend NWR meetings if her
   husband is away because employing a babysitter would "leave me
   guilt-ridden".

   So although most women can now define themselves by a paid job, it is
   often a definition in addition to, not instead of, domestic labour.
   Pauline Reymond, long-time NWR member and regional organiser in
   Worthing, joined the group when she was 29 and her child started
   school. Now 64, she notes that members have "partners" as well as
   husbands and many are divorced, widowed or remarried. Her life goes
   some way to explaining how, just as the term "housewife" has been made
   redundant by social forces, so it was also created by them. Reymond had
   to give up her job as a secretary at Royal Exchange Insurance because
   the company did not employ married women. "It was the way things were,"
   she says.

   Though Reymond would not have to leave her job today, some things
   haven't changed: no matter what we call them, it is still women who do
   most of the housework. The last Office of National Statistics figures
   showed that, at £739bn, unpaid housework was worth more than the value
   of the formal economy. And domesticity is still hard work. The best
   outcome to hope for, as far as the NWR goes, is that it will continue
   to fall victim to its own success.

   The construction of Monkton Cokeworks on the outskirts of Hebburn in
   the mid 1930s was a well-intentioned project.

   Built on former farmland, the sprawling complex provided work for
   hundreds of men at a time of mass unemployment as the Great Depression
   wreaked economic havoc around the world, and especially on Tyneside
   where it spawned the 1936 Jarrow Crusade. But over time, the plant
   became universally regarded as a giant blot on the landscape, pumping
   out continuous smoke and grime and becoming a major environmental and
   health issue for those who lived nearby.

   A newly-published book, Clean Air , tells the story of the rise of
   everyday housewife Jennie Shearan to campaigning environmentalist. It
   was written by her grandson, Gianfranco Rosolia, who was born and
   raised on Tyneside, but currently lives in Los Angeles.

   venue today

   Clean Air relates the story of people who lived on the doorstep of
   Monkton Cokeworks from 1953 to 1990. Their daily reality was a
   nightmare of hazardous and acrid sulphur dioxide emissions,
   all-pervading soot, and clamorous noisy tannoys.

   Over decades, the facility grew unflaggingly, converting
   ever-increasing quantities of coal into coke without concern for the
   residents’ well-being. In forming the Hebburn Residents’ Action Group,
   Jennie Shearan brought together the underrepresented residents of
   Monkton Lane Estate, and gave them a voice, igniting a national
   dialogue about the health risks from the pollution that her
   neighbourhood had to endure.

   1980s, from the book Clean Air

   While the events in the book took place on South Tyneside over 30 years
   ago, there remains a resonance to the challenges Jennie Shearan had to
   overcome during her campaign for environmental justice. She battled a
   negligent big energy firm that prioritised profit over people,
   governmental bodies that lacked accountability, and institutional
   sexism. She took on all levels of the establishment, from British Coal
   to Margaret Thatcherʼs government, galvanising her underrepresented
   town and bringing her case all the way to the European Parliament.

   Jennie’s grandson, author of Clean Air , Gianfranco Rosolia, says:
   “Throughout her arduous journey, Jennie was brave, steadfast and
   sincere, demonstrating a level of resourcefulness and tenacity that
   would inspire any leader, the capacity to corral a group around a
   single-minded vision that any politician could learn from, and a degree
   of resilience that can energise us all.

   “The book illustrates the countless sacrifices and bold choices that
   Jennie made, the effectiveness of grassroots activism and people power,
   and the beauty of leaving behind a better world for future generations.
   Jennie Shearan and the Hebburn Residents’ Action Group deeply loved
   their community. They put their heart and spirit into improving the
   lives of ordinary people. Their redoubtable efforts left a deeply
   positive and long-lasting legacy, giving thousands of people hope for a
   stronger and healthier future and transforming their quality of life.

   "To continue their good work, all proceeds from CLEAN AIR will go
   directly to three charities that represent what Jennie was fighting
   for: Hebburn Helps , Friends of the Earth , The Environmental Law
   Foundation .”

   The book has received praise from some notable supporters, including
   Geordie rock star Sting who said: “This is an inspirational story about
   female empowerment, grassroots activism and environmental justice. What
   an eloquent spokesperson Jennie Shearan was.”

   Monkton Cokeworks finally closed in 1990 and was demolished two years
   later. Three decades on, the area has been reclaimed as a pleasant
   green space, and its paths are popular with walkers and cyclists.
   Jennie Shearer died aged 82 in 2005.

   Clean Air by Gianfranco Rosolia is available in paperback and ebook
   (both £9.99), and hardcover and audiobook (£15.99). You can buy the
   book directly from the author, or at Amazon or Apple Books. The book is
   available in paperback, hardcover, ebook and audiobook. For further

     * Claim: The government will be distributing monthly cash aid
       amounting to P10,000 to solo parents, mothers, and housewives.
     * Rating: FALSE
     * The facts: As of writing, there are no announcements from the
       national government regarding this.
     * Why we fact checked this: The video containing this claim has now
       reached over 71,000 reactions on Facebook.

Complete details

   Since July 13, a video has been circulating on Facebook containing the
   claim that solo parents, mothers, and housewives will be given a
   P10,000 monthly allowance from the government.

   This is false.

   As of July 2022, there are no announcements from the national
   government regarding this.

   There have also been no new reports from local governments and
   government agencies regarding any monthly allowance to be given to
   these groups.

   Last June, the Expanded Solo Parents Welfare Act or Republic Act No.
   11861 lapsed into law. The law includes new provisions such as the
   distribution of P1,000 cash subsidy to solo parents whose income is
   below the poverty line and 20% discount on infant formula, diapers,
   medicines, vaccines, and other necessities.

   Rappler has recently debunked multiple claims regarding supposedly new
   cash aid distribution programs by the government that may be found
   here. – Sofia Guanzon/Rappler.com

Sarawak cops enlist housewives to help eradicate crime
     __________________________________________________________________

     * Sabah &amp; Sarawak
     * Saturday, 27 Aug 2022
       7:23 PM MYT

   SIBU: Sarawak police will mobilise the participation of housewives in
   the state to combat crime in housing estates through the Sarawak
   contingent’s Amanita (special female personnel unit) housing estate
   adoption programme which was launched on Saturday (Aug 27).

   Sarawak police commissioner Datuk Mohd Azman Ahmad Sapri (pic) said the
   garden adoption initiative aims to increase the involvement of police
   officers to be closer to residents in housing areas as well as
   communicating with housewives in an effort to prevent crime.

   He said Amanita was a special unit under the police that was
   established in March 2013 to obtain information related to unreported
   crimes in the community in an effort to help the police reduce crime
   rates.

   "Amanita officers will hold a collaboration between policewomen and
   housewives. This Amanita housing estate adoption initiative will also
   make the residential area a safer place.

   "This cooperation is expected to help the police in terms of channeling
   information related to crime. If they find that there are suspicious
   things happening in the surrounding area, they can contact them
   directly and report to the police immediately," he said at the launch
   of the Taman Kemuyang Amanita Housing Estate Adoption Programme here
   Saturday.

   Comm Azman said housewives were the right group to pass on information
   to the police because they are always at home and are aware of the
   happenings in their neighbourhood.

   "So, they have the right to be given a mandate to jointly prevent local
   crime by reporting to the police," he explained and added that the
   selection criteria for adoption was based on the crime index in an
   area.

   He added that by making Kemuyang Park an Amanita adopted area, it will
   not only benefit the local residents but surrounding areas estimated to
   have around 5,000 residents as well. - Bernama

Dad Asks If He's Wrong For 'Encouraging' His Daughter To Be A Housewife

   By Isaac Serna-Diez — Written on May 28, 2022

   Dad and daughter playing

   A 24-year-old father is struggling to raise his daughter that he had
   when he was only 19, and as such, does his best to support her in
   everything that she says and does in order to keep her happy.

   When the five-year-old girl was cycling through the future jobs she
   wanted as most five-year-olds do, one of the ones she landed on got her
   father in trouble with his neighbors.

The father was called out for “encouraging” his daughter to become a
housewife.

   “Everyday has been a struggle and most of the time I don't even know if
   what I am doing is right so the thought of unintentionally hurting my
   daughter is filling me with guilt,” wrote the father on the subreddit
   “r/AmItheA--hole” (AITA).

   AITA is a Reddit forum for people who are unsure if they’re doing the
   right thing.

   After She Took Their Daughter’s Things

   People will post their problems, their arguments with family, their
   struggles with raising children, or whatever else is ailing them in the
   hopes that the strangers perusing the site will give their unbiased
   opinion that will hopefully validate their decisions.

   Posts are given a rating, the most common ones being “You’re The
   A--hole” (YTA) and “Not The A--hole” (NTA), but there are other ones
   just in case things are a little more complicated than they seem.

   “My daughter is at that stage where kids pretend they are grown-ups
   with jobs,” the father wrote.

   “The jobs differ depending on who she meets or sees on the TV. In the
   last few months, she wanted to be a teacher, babysitter, truck driver,
   president, garbage collector, photographer, ‘knee doctor’ (after I
   injured it), scientist, witch, [and] football steward.”

   &amp;embed=true&amp;showmedia=false&amp;theme=dark

   Like any father of a five-year-old child, he did his best to support
   her by playing along, buying her anything he could afford that would
   help her play the role.

   When an old friend of his came to visit and revealed that she was a
   housewife, the five-year-old cycled to her new profession.

   He explains that his daughter has now started playing house and
   expressing her interest in being a housewife.

   &amp;embed=true&amp;showmedia=false&amp;theme=dark

   When his neighbors caught wind of the situation, however, they were
   angry with him.

   “They told me we aren't in the 60s anymore and young girls shouldn't
   dream about being [housewives] anymore and demanded I stop brainwashing
   my daughter because her subconscious will start settling for being a
   housewife instead of dreaming about bigger things,” he wrote.

   On The Street After She Made A Mess In His Home

   Fortunately, Reddit was on his side and even commended his parenting
   efforts.

   Many sympathized with him, offering up the commonly-known but hardly
   spoken fact that all parents are winging it and hoping that it goes
   right.

   Being a parent is very difficult. Maintaining another human’s happiness
   all while trying to teach them the right things, behave in the right
   way, and express themselves in a healthy manner, is no easy feat.

   The fact that he’s supporting her in the way that he is was enough for
   the majority of Redditors to give him the NTA rating because a lot of
   parents don’t even do the bare minimum of supporting their children’s
   dreams.

   Plus, she’s only five years old.

Working woman versus Housewife

   Money is the only reason to choose a working wife
   Rayees Ahmad Kumar

   The most common misunderstanding among the people, especially among
   those having a materialistic approach, is that a lady working in a
   government department, a private company or a multinational corporation
   is to be regarded as a working woman, whereas a lady who isn’t working
   in such departments or companies, but is doing all the household tasks
   from dusk to dawn tirelessly like cooking, washing, taking care of
   children and many other such jobs, is called a non-working woman or
   housewife.

   Can we call a lady drawing a monthly salary a working woman and the one
   making our life easy, comfortable and pleasant a non-working woman? No
   and absolutely never. If we make a review of the daily routine and
   needs of a home if it is to run smoothly, we come to a conclusion that
   it is a woman who has made it run smoothly and with utmost success.

   the public or private sector, his next priority has always been to
   marry a good girl. Among many criteria fixed by intending grooms for
   choosing a woman as a wife, one of the most important is whether to
   marry a working woman or a stay-at-home housewife. His own choice, the
   wish of his parents and the opinion of his close friends or colleagues
   directly have an impact on his final decision about marrying a working
   woman or a stay-at-home housewife.

   It can be undoubtedly said that the rising inflation and the
   skyrocketing prices of essentials, becoming more expensive with each
   passing day, are compelling today’s youth to look for a match with a
   working woman, but there are certainly other reasons also because of
   which they prefer a working woman over a non-working one. Sometimes a
   government employee or an officer in government department regards it
   as an insult to choose a non-working woman when he finds his own
   friends or colleagues marrying working women. Living a luxurious life,
   having a better standard of life and maximising one’s desires is
   forcing almost every individual to seek ways for a good income from all
   available means. Marrying a working woman is one such means to increase
   one’s income to meet one’s expenses.

   However there is also a good percentage of people who, despite being in
   government service, prefer to marry a non-working woman. For this they
   have their own reasons and aspirations. For a good service at home and
   living their own comfortable and stress-free life, they prefer to a
   have a nonworking woman staying at home.

   Though at the time of wedding or choosing one’a life partner, one feels
   delighted to have a working woman for a partner but after some time
   things make one realize that he hasn’t taken a good decision. In a
   joint family, often the situation takes an ugly turn and mostly the
   couple feel worried when the working daughter in-law doesn’t receive a
   good cooperation from her husband’s parents and other in-laws.

   When the lunch, dinner and two times tea for the husband and in-laws
   gets late due to the known reasons of the daughter in-law, everybody in
   the family gets worried and sometimes force the daughter in-law to say
   goodbye to her service.

Due to the over-busy schedule, the working couple faces many problems and
issues both at home as well as outside the home. There is a common saying
that “money can’t buy everything”, so a working couple with a materialistic
mind, intent on making wealth and gathering all luxuries for their life,
always find themselves lamenting in the end.

   A working woman may not be able to manage her children the way they
   should be. After coming back from the school when the children find
   themselves alone in the house and wait for hours together for their
   parents, their personality isn’t developed properly because parents’,
   and especially the mother’s, love, affection and presence is a must in
   the early few years of the child’s growth and development. The strong
   and humanistic fabric of the family gets altogether shattered when
   parents, children and siblings don’t get required time in expressing
   their problems or issues and discussing about the proper way out so
   that each family member doesn’t feel alienated. At many instances it
   has been found that the aged and ailing parents of the working couple
   were either found dead in their own rooms without being noticed by any
   family member or were taken to hospitals by the people other than those
   duty-bound to do so. The social life of the working couple too gets
   affected due to their over-busy schedule. They can’t reach their loved
   ones, near and dear ones or relatives on the specific occasions.

   On the other hand a stay-at-home housewife, who always serves her
   husband with utmost care and honesty, takes care of husband’s ailing
   and aged parents and manages her children with true spirit of a mother,
   is regarded as a successful woman by all in and outside the family. A
   non-working lady can best serve her husband, manage the home and her
   social life too remains intact. The family members of her home, her
   neighbours and relatives unanimously praise her for the extraordinary
   skills she shows in managing the home and taking care of every aspect
   of family life.

   One more important aspect is that the working women often become
   victims of depression and mental trauma while their non-working
   counterparts often live a happy, prosperous and contended life.

Let’s be proud of the women making their life decisions of their free will,
whether they choose to fly a plane 30,000 feet above sea level or to run a
home the way they wish. They never needed your permission anyway.

   My mother is an urban woman who had an English-medium education. She
   has Bachelors and Master’s degrees in Arts, and is a voracious reader.
   She’s never shied away from speaking her mind and has almost never been
   politically correct. The word “diplomatic” doesn’t exist in my mother’s
   dictionary. She wears whatever she likes whenever she likes, others’
   opinions be damned. She stands her own ground in arguments no matter
   who’s at the other end, seldom puts up with people’s nonsense (she
   gives it back in equal measure), and has always been a self-assured
   woman. She’s one of the most confident people I’ve ever known, forever
   comfortable in her 61-year-old skin.

   My mother is also a housewife by choice, and has been one since the day
   she got married.

   Surprised? More often than not, we think of the housewives around us –
   whether mothers, grandmothers, aunts or neighbours – as though cut from
   the same domesticated cloth. Many from the millennial generation think
   that all they do is cater to their husbands, houses, and kids, and
   otherwise just “do nothing at all”.  Even the movies we grew up on show
   homemakers as in-law-worshipping, always submissive to their husbands
   and families, weak, and rarely opinionated or having strong
   personalities, or any personality at all. Thanks, Bollywood. But why
   can’t we showcase, or be okay with, badass women choosing to be
   housewives?

   I’ve asked my mom on many occasions, like we tend to question most
   homemakers, whether she’s ever dreamt of pursuing a career or having an
   income. “Do you think you were brought up just on money? I provided
   everything else,” comes the proud response. My mother was perfectly
   happy being the provider of everything apart for the salary – her
   ambition was to be a mother, at any and every time her kids needed her.
   She did work before she got married, first teaching at a kindergarten
   and then at a desk job for a while, but never developed a liking for
   the work life. She’s never regretted her choice, or let anyone make her
   feel ashamed or guilty for it. And we shouldn’t either.

   What’s it that they do at home? Till my brother and I were almost
   adults, we didn’t have a driver, a cook, or full-time domestic help. It
   was my mom – like countless other homemakers – who travelled by BEST
   buses to drop and fetch us from birthday parties and swimming classes,
   walked to bazaars to stock up the kitchen and cook our meals, helped
   with our homework whenever needed, attended all PTA meetings,
   accompanied us to the doctor, and cared for us when we were sick. And
   she still made time for herself – to read, do her beloved newspaper
   crosswords and sudokus, meet friends, shop, write her daily diary, or
   do whatever else she wanted.

     If women who choose to be housewives are truly owning it, who are we
     to look down at them?

   From a young age, my brother and I were taught to be independent and
   self-reliant, my mom forcing me to travel alone by bus by the age of 10
   so that I didn’t need her to fetch me from friends’ houses. She stayed
   out of our sibling fights “because you need to learn to deal with
   problems yourself”, and made both my brother and me do several
   household chores (PSA: kids are “free house help” for middle-class
   families). She taught me to fill pass books and do the rounds of banks
   for financial work in the pre-netbanking era. I could go to her for any
   questions I had about boys, periods, sex, and everything else under the
   sun, even if they got a little weird. And no matter how many times I
   asked if she’d ever had great ambitions outside the four walls of our
   home, she had only one answer: that she was happiest being a homemaker,
   and had no qualms wearing that badge with pride.

   If women who choose to be housewives are truly owning it, who are we to
   look down at them? We shame our kind for choosing to “sit at home and
   do nothing” (have you ever seen a housewife’s schedule?), or assume
   that she’s confined to the home life because of outside factors – not
   having qualifications or finding a job, family objections or because
   she’s unambitious. Why can’t we treat the homemakers around us with the
   same respect that we give that CEO who’s killing it in the boardroom or
   the lawyer who spends hours poring over her case files?

   There are those though, who say that being a housewife is the most
   thankless unpaid job, and that once in a while we should express our
   gratitude to the ladies who spend all their days at home, for
   everything they do for us. But all they need is the same respect one
   gives a career-woman for the choices she makes – for isn’t that what
   feminism is all about? Let’s be proud of the women making their life
   decisions of their free will, whether they choose to fly a plane 30,000
   feet above sea level or to run a home the way they wish. They never
   needed your permission anyway. At least my mom doesn’t.

Stigma of being a housewife

   Fatima Dabeer

   July 13, 2018

   With the revolutionary growth of feminism and woman coming out as bold
   and strong, the importance of housewives is deteriorating. Where all
   the women are talking about coming out of the comforts of their homes
   to compete with men in all fields of life, no one talks about the
   efforts of housewives. In the past, women were expected to stay home
   and run all the household errands, and those who wanted to work were
   often stigmatised. However, now in the modern world, it is the other
   way round.

   The word has now got a negative connotation and is often associated
   with women who don’t want to work and would rather live off their
   partner. Most housewives are undervalued by their partners and by
   society at large. Across the world, women who stay home are now known
   to be old fashioned and an economic burden to the society. Their daily
   chores; cleaning, cooking and raising their children are neglected on
   national levels. With women competing men at economic and social
   levels, stay-at-home moms are valued way less. Housework has always
   been sore spot for all feminists and for all the stay-at-home mothers;
   it has never gained them adequate respect.

     Across the world, women who stay home are now known to be old
     fashioned and an economic burden to the society

   Do we really respect the women who do our household chores? Do we value
   them as husbands, children and a member of the society?
   [INS: :INS]

   It is not only about the acknowledgment of the errands they run, but
   also how we all look down upon them, deprive them from the appreciation
   they deserve and the power to make decisions on their own. Edgell, a
   sociologists, claims that the female population is only dominated in
   the areas of interior decorations, domestic spending and children’s
   clothes; all considered to be insignificant. Marjorie L Devault talks
   about the invisible work done by the housewives; how they are concerned
   about every family member’s food preferences, their health and
   organizing the family to come together. In all these they lose their
   own preferences, desire, luxury time and relaxing hours. Jean Duncombe
   in her study found out that majority of the housewives are playing a
   major part in holding their relationships together by doing the crucial
   and tiring emotional work. It puts an emotional strain on them but it
   is a price that they pay to keep the family together.

   Various celebrities and writers have presented their perspective on
   being a housewife. Annie Dillard says: “I’m a housewife: I spend far
   more time on housework than anything else.” Celine Dion claims: “I have
   become a housewife and there is no better job.” Tamara Braxton says: “I
   never want my kids to feel like I’m just some housewife, kicking it
   with my husband, because that’s not the kind of woman I am.” Martha
   Plimpton states: “I’m so sick of hearing how there’s no strong roles
   for women. I don’t care about strong roles. I just want to see women
   who are characters! A nun, a serial killer, a housewife, as long as
   there’s some depth there.”

   Our mothers, sisters and daughters, all those who are housewives act as
   a sponge to soak all the tensions and problems to create our homes a
   safe haven. It is wrong of us to look at the housewives as lazy,
   unaware of the social world and degrading them for the immense amount
   of work they perform from just the four walls of our homes. It is said
   that it is the duty of the man to maintain the financial stability of
   the house, in the same way men and children are dependent on the
   housewives for stability in domestic life, family bonding and mental
   peace. They should be equally credited as a woman doing a job outside
   the house. They deserve every ounce of acknowledgment.

My Story: I am not a wife but a maid for my husband

   Question: I am a married woman. I am regretting getting married a lot.
   This is because my husband does not do any household work. Even after
   eating food, he does not even lift his plate. However, I have no
   problem with them doing their job. I want to be a good housewife, but I
   also have a small child to take care of, which makes me very tired.
   On the other hand, even after seeing my condition, my husband does not
   feel any pity for me. Whenever I ask him for some work, he starts
   making excuses about his job. He doesn’t care about any household
   responsibilities. This is also one of the reasons why I have started
   feeling like her maidservant. I do not know what to do? But to tell the
   truth, if everything continues like this, then I will go mad. (All
   images are indicative, we protect the identity of users in the stories
   shared by them)

Expert Answer

   Relationship coach and founder of Predictions for Success Vishal
   Bhardwaj says that taking care of the household is not a single
   person’s job, especially in nuclear families. This is because a
   housewife struggles a lot during this time.

   This is also one of the reasons that if she does not get the support of
   her partner, she not only gets very tired mentally but the burden of
   physical work also falls on her. In such a situation, she not only
   becomes a victim of severe depression but also suffers from lack of
   self-confidence and sleep related problems.

   My Story: Husband does not allow me to wear short clothes, also has
   objection to wearing red lipstick, says other men will be attracted

get used to their help

   As you told that your husband does not even lift his plate after
   eating. In such a situation, I would advise you to start defining your
   work. Not only this, also start taking help of your partner to complete
   those tasks which he can easily do.

   For example, if you like to cook well, you can take their help in
   chopping vegetables. This will not only create a feeling of love
   between the two of you but things will also start getting better soon.

   My story: Within 7 months of marriage, my wife made my life difficult,
   I do not understand what sin I have committed

talk to husband

   On this topic, relationship expert Nidhi Behl Vats says that the best
   thing is that you understand that both of you have to play equal roles
   to make your marriage work. This is because many times men dominate
   their wives and refuse to work, after which women take care of the
   family alone. So I would say that you have won half the battle.

   But even after this you have to maintain a balance with your husband.
   You have to include them in your works. You two can make breakfast
   together. If you want, you can also take their help in preparing lunch.
   Have a healthy conversation with them right there. Tell them how much
   pressure has come on you after the birth of the child.

Help from housewives turns hobby into business
       World 22h ago

Hundreds of trucks snarl Bolivia farm region as blockades hit business

   Mositol (right) introducing the different types of herbs to some
   housewives in Ranau.

   KOTA KINABALU: A farmer who tried her hand at planting herbs and edible
   flowers as a hobby has turned it into a source of income not only for
   herself, but a group of housewives in Ranau district as well.

   Irene Mositol, 31, founder of DumoWongi (scented farm), now has more
   than 70 people working with her.

   She buys fresh produce from local planters and handles the packaging,
   quality control and marketing.

   She was recently named grand winner for the Social Impact Category in
   the 2022 Shell LiveWIRE global Top 10 Innovators Award, an
   entrepreneurial competition which rewards entrepreneurs who demonstrate
   excellence in innovation.

   The mother of one won US$20,000 (RM89,600) after beating 195
   entrepreneurs from 17 participating countries around the world.

   Mositol said she initially wanted to get into vegetable farming.

   “However, when officials from Shell came to visit my farm in Bundu
   Tuhan for an inspection as I had signed up to be part of the LiveWIRE
   programme, they saw that I also had several pots of herbs,” she said in
   a recent interview.

   She said they asked why she did not want to cultivate herbs instead as
   there was high demand in the food and beverage industry and very few
   people were doing it in Sabah.

   Mositol then decided to just give it a try, learning about cultivating
   herbs through the Internet step by step.

   She bought the potted herbs from another farmer in Kundasang, and tried
   to get more varieties from other sources including supermarkets.

   “I started it as a hobby at the end of 2018 and only got serious during
   the Covid-19 pandemic,” she said.

   The temperature and weather in places like Bundu Tuhan and Kundasang
   are cooler because they are located in the highlands.

   Mositol said with effort and focus, she started seeing the potential
   and monetary returns, prompting curious housewives to enquire and
   subsequently start planting herbs as well.

   They started out with herbs like rosemary, thyme and oregano before
   expanding to edible flowers.

   They have fresh as well as dried herbs packed in bottles for sale.

   Mositol herself now has over 40 types of herbs and edible flowers
   planted around her farm, and manages her own processing house.

   “I am glad that what I am doing has an economic impact on other women
   as well, because as we know, the pandemic really hit hard and many are
   struggling financially,” she said.

   She added that with assistance from companies such as Shell, they
   learned to improve their business and standard of living.

   Asked about the challenges faced by herb farmers like herself, Mositol
   counted the lack of local planters, weather conditions, and information
   on plant diseases among some of them.

   “At the moment, we are faced with a type of plant disease and are
   trying to find local solutions and formulas to stop its spread, as it
   can affect the growth and quality of our herbs and edible flowers,” she
   added.

   PUTRAJAYA: A total of 1,092 housewives have registered under the
   Housewives Social Security Scheme (SKSSR), says V. Sivakumar.

   The Human Resources Minister said the number was recorded in the first
   seven days since the scheme was implemented on Dec 1.

   The ministry, he said, targeted 500,000 registrations from the total
   2.9 million housewives by next year.

   “The initiative is open to all Malaysian citizens and permanent
   residents, aged below 55, with no minimum age limit for those who wish
   to contribute.

   “Housewives eligible for the scheme will have to contribute RM120 per
   year in advance to receive domestic disaster benefits and invalidity
   benefits for 12 months,” he told a press conference yesterday.

   Benefit payments under the scheme range from RM200 to RM50,000,
   depending on the types of benefits and injuries.

   Resources Ministry in Putrajaya. — Bernama We’ve got you covered:

   Among the benefits under both protections are medical, permanent
   disability, constant-attendance-allowance, facilities for physical or
   dialysis, funeral benefits and survivors’ pension.

   Sivakumar said the scheme would also cover housewives when they were
   outside their house to perform domestic duties such as picking up their
   children from the school or accidents while shopping for groceries.

   He said SKSSR was different from commercial insurance as it provides a
   low premium but offers a wider coverage.

   The scheme is also open to all including those with pre-existing health
   problems.

   Sivakumar also said SKSSR differs from i-Suri, which does not cover
   non-working women.

   Those who wish to register under the scheme can do so via the Social
   Security Organisation (Socso) website. Payment can be done online or at
   all Socso counters.

The real house wives of the world

   This article looks at the real lives of women who choose to stay at
   home and be housewives and full-time mothers

   By Samantha Chapman

   With more women choosing to be stay at home mothers and housewives what
   does this really mean and do stereotypical opinions surrounding it need
   to change?

   In this article I will look at the women who stay at home, looking at
   the judgement they receive from others on this decision and also why
   they have made the choice not to ‘work’ in a typical sense of the word,
   and most importantly what it really means to be a stay at home
   mam/housewife.

   Stay at home mothers and housewives often face judgement on this choice
   and like every aspect of life face stereotyping especially derived from
   the media.

   Television shows such as ‘The real housewives of...’ has painted an
   image of those who choose to stay at home of one of glamour, where
   wealth and excess are priority and the women have one goal that very
   rarely tends to be what benefits those around them.

   This is, however, very rarely a reflection of the majority of how these
   women live. Keeping the ideas of the representation in the media of
   these women I Spoke to Darlene Smith Meadows, a stay at home wife and
   mother from Mid-Georgia USA, who had this to say “I honestly work
   harder at home than I ever did when I was working outside the home.
   Ladies of Leisure? Maybe some are… I most definitely am not.”

   There are so many different viewpoints of the reasons behind others
   staying at home, from just asking a handful of people the variation in
   answers and opinions is remarkable from ‘being lazy’ too ‘making a huge
   sacrifice staying at home to put all their effort into family life’.
   There is no shortage of differing opinions. Even to the women
   themselves choosing to stay at home it means a different thing to each
   of them.

   One Housewife, Lisa Jones from Melbourne Australia, believes being a
   housewife in the 21^st century is “A decision to put the needs of my
   family first and provide for the household in ways other than
   financial.”

   Mrs Meadows believes “It looks different to each woman who does it. I
   could just be a stay at home wife/mama and still send my children off
   to school, buy everything rather than making it, but I choose to be,
   not only a thrifty wife, but a concerned and informed wife and mother.”

   While Samantha Chapman a stay at home mother from Sunderland told us
   how “It is still important that I teach my children that working and
   earning is something you need to do in some section of your life. It
   helps to understand the value of money. It is a hectic life, but I love
   my children dearly and understand people have their own opinion”.

   These are three women who chose to stay at home, but all have differing
   views about what is important and what is means to be a stay at home
   mother or housewife. So, with differing opinions what does research
   say?

   A Poll by Gallup revealed that more stay at home mams report feeling
   sadness or anger in their everyday than women who work outside of the
   home. 60,000 women were surveyed including working mams, say at home
   mams, women with no children. While the majority of stay at home mams
   reported feelings of stress the previous day, it is important to
   realise that while the numbers are bigger the differences isn’t huge.
   42% of stay at home mams reported they were struggling while the number
   of working mothers was 36%

   The study concludes it is important that every stay-at-home mam has an
   established support network, including regular outings with friends to
   get that much-needed break and prevent ‘mommy burnout’.

   Lisa told me how “until recently, I have always worked full time
   juggling 90% of the house running load which lead to a lot of burn out
   and disappointment that home life seemed to come second to work and
   life. When I worked, I would have killed for this kind of like balance!
   Living the dream really!”

   So, while each woman copes and works differently, when speaking to
   these women there is one thing that most seem to agree on and was often
   brought up. That there is still a stigma attached to being at home.

   We spoke about the stigma to Beth Larson a stay at home mam from Neoga
   IL. Her opinion on this topic was that “There is definitely a stigma
   that is carefully taught throughout the educational system about ‘stay
   at home moms’. The premise being that we are not intelligent enough to
   do anything else. I remember being told many times that ‘the speaker’
   was jealous of being able to lay on the couch eating bon-bons and
   watching TV all day. (Like I ever have time for that!)”

   Mrs Jones had also had similar experiences in another part of the world
   with similar stereotyping “People have all sorts of opinions. Mostly
   surrounding my marriage (husband is controlling, lazy or abusive), or
   there being something secretly wrong with my health or mental health.
   It’s mostly women who can’t understand not financially contributing to
   the household and men think I’m some sort of slave.”

   A desire for family flexibility is the first reason why 90% of stay at
   home mothers choose to do so. Choosing to work from home is a choice
   that comes from looking at happiness and struggling to balance work
   with parenting.

   Melinda Pittser from Pennsylvania told us how hard she works in the
   home, ‘waking up at 5:30 to get herself ready for the day before making
   sure each of her children are up and ready to start their day.’ Making
   sure their families are happy is the full-time job for these women.

   The stereotyping and stigma facing women who stay home is the same in
   many parts of the world from England to Australia. Media is a huge
   contribution towards this and something corporations need to address,
   with an increase in women choosing to stay at home it is becoming more
   important that the stigma begins to change and become that of a more
   positive one that see’s the reasoning behind each women’s choice.

   For many of these women staying at home comes from both desire and also
   convenience. Looking after a household is a full-time job for these
   women and many choose to add more work on top. It’s a choice each woman
   makes to best suit themselves and their life.

Is TikTok housewives trend encouraging women to be 'submissive'?

   By Samantha Kamman, Christian Post Reporter
   Housewife, baking Getty Images

   A TikTok trend of stay-at-home moms sharing their daily routine of
   performing domestic work has prompted a debate about whether it
   encourages women to be submissive.

   As Insider reported earlier this month, women showcasing their lives as
   homemakers is part of a trend of American women making “trad wife”
   (traditional wife) content showing the positive aspects of being a
   housewife. The trad wife hashtag has more than 96 million views on
   TikTok, with some users incorporating it into their usernames.

   Estee C. Williams, a 24-year-old who creates content for TikTok,
   defines trad wife as a woman “who chooses to live a more traditional
   life with ultra-traditional gender roles."

   Williams lives in Virginia with her husband, Conner. In June, the
   homemaker posted a video listing all the things she does to make her
   life more enjoyable, including listening to music while cleaning,
   wearing makeup and cute house dresses, and taking candle-lit baths.

   In an interview with Insider, Williams said she is not disparaging
   women’s right to work, but adds that housewives like her believe many
   “women have drifted far from [our] roots.”

   "For me, the hustle culture was not appealing. Being a wife, mom,
   making delicious home-cooked meals for my family, and keeping up a
   warm, inviting home is what truly spoke to me,” Williams said.

   The social media influencer added that working can be good for some
   women, but fears many in the workforce suffer from burnout.

   "I choose to promote this lifestyle to showcase the fulfillment this
   lifestyle gives,” she said.

   According to a 2020 analysis conducted by Great Place to Work and
   healthcare start-up Maven, mothers in paid employment are 23% more
   likely to experience burnout than fathers in paid employment.

   The study surveyed over 1,200 U.S. companies and over 400,000 working
   parents. The analysis included 226,000 working mothers and 204,000
   working fathers, having them respond to 60 questions through Great
   Place to Work’s Trust Index survey.

   An estimated 2.35 million working mothers in the U.S. suffered from
   burnout during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly “due to
   unequal demands of home and work,” according to the study.

   Another survey conducted by the business networking site LinkedIn
   assessed nearly 5,000 members on the site between July 31 and Aug. 13
   last year. The study found that while working women and men face
   similar stresses, the intensity level was always higher for women.

   Seventy-four percent of women said they felt “very or somewhat
   stressed” for work-related reasons, compared to 64% of working men.

   Forty percent of working women cited “not having enough time in the day
   to get everything done” as one of their top stress factors, versus just
   35% of male respondents.

   The Insider report noted that some trad wives believe that feminism has
   persuaded women to enter the workforce instead of being full-time wives
   and mothers. Deborah Etienne, a Brandwatch data analyst and researcher
   tracking the social media trend, asserted that "many trad wives reject
   feminism, claiming it has destroyed everything."

   Whitman College sociologist Michelle Janning told Insider that the
   chaos of the pandemic might have influenced some women to be full-time
   stay-at-home mothers. According to Janning, the stress of working
   outside the home during this time might have led some women to decide
   that being at home was the best option.

   "As a sociologist, I would say, when people collectively feel like
   there's not a lot of control in the world, you cling to something
   familiar, and concrete because it might be comfortable," she told
   Insider.

   Janning also cautioned that not all trad wives are creating content to
   promote homemaking as a healthy lifestyle. She claimed that some might
   use the trend to champion "conservative or white supremacist views."
   Another TikTok user that once identified as a trad wife, Madison
   Dastrup, stopped associating with the term in September for this
   reason.

   The sociologist further added that some of these women on TikTok are
   actually pursuing a career “outside the home” by working as social
   media influencers.

   "It could be that they're not selling a product but selling a version
   of themselves, and their husband will be getting the sponsorship,”
   Janning said. “It's a contradiction: their job is to tell people they
   don't have a job."

   She went on to insinuate that society’s “gender system” tells women
   that being a homemaker is a lifestyle choice, but it’s really pushing
   them toward the role of a full-time housewife.

   "It's less of a choice than maybe we think it is,” Janning said.

   Abby Roth, a conservative and host of the "Classically Abby" podcast,
   which promotes classic feminist values, examined the #TradWide trend in
   a May 2020 article at Evie. Roth claimed that some versions of the
   trend “demean women” instead of merely celebrating stay-at-home moms.

   Some definitions of the trend, Roth explained, claim that women can
   only be traditional if they stay home full-time.

   “A classic woman can be a traditional wife and mother even if she does
   work because she knows that her passion for her work is there to
   support her traditional life at home,” she wrote. “Where feminism
   proposes that women should actively choose career over family, being
   classic says that work and family can go hand-in-hand.”

   The feminist emphasized that a husband and wife must commit to growing
   alongside one another, encouraging each other to become better versions
   of themselves. She argued that the #Trad trend appears to discourage
   women from speaking to their husbands about how to improve their
   character.

   “Because this #Trad definition expects wives to be submissive and
   husbands to be dominant, it creates an inherent power imbalance in the
   relationship,” Roth wrote at the time.

   She asserted that marriages “should be based on partnership, not
   subservience.”

   According to a YouGov survey from the Institute for Family
   Studies/Wheatley Institution of 2,500 American adults, ages 18-55,
   conducted from May 28 to June 10 last year, 53% of parents with
   children younger than 18 prefer working from home most of the time or
   half of the time due to the pandemic.

   Sixty-five percent of college-educated fathers supported the idea of
   working from home at least half the time or most of the time.
   Approximately 44% supported working from home most of the time, while
   21% support working from home half of the time. Among college-educated
   mothers, some 57% endorse the shift.

   Mothers were more likely than fathers to voice a preference for having
   flexible work hours and sharing childcare responsibilities with their
   partners. Nearly 30% of moms and dads believe one parent staying home
   full-time is the “best arrangement” for children under 5.

   The researchers behind the survey concluded that their results support
   the idea that most parents caring for their children themselves if
   their work arrangement allows it.

   housewife suicide rate highest in india

   The NCRB data for 2021 was released on 30 August 2022 and once again,
   housewives accounted for the majority of the female victims in India.
   They also constitute nearly 14.1% of total victims who died by suicides
   (23,179 out of 1,64,033).

   A total of 45,026 women died by suicide in 2021 in the country and out
   of them housewives accounted for the majority of those deaths (23,178).
   51.5% of the total female victims were housewives.

   Over the years, the data on housewives (higher than 50% suicide cases)
   has remained constant. The NCRB data for the four years leading up to
   2021 show that,
     * In 2020, housewives accounted for 50.3% of the total female
       victims.
     * In 2019, housewives accounted for 51.5% of the total female
       victims.
     * In 2018, housewives accounted for 54.1% of the total female
       victims.
     * In 2017, housewives accounted for 51.3% of the total female victims

Why Are Suicide Cases On The Rise Among Housewives?

   housewife suicide cases

   To learn the cause of the consistently high cases of suicide among
   housewives, we spoke with Dr. Ruhi Satija, a consultant psychiatrist
   and counselling therapist at cloud nine hospitals.

   She spoke about the various challenges women have to face as
   homemakers, which could be contributing factors.

Being A Housewife Is A Hard Job

   Becoming a housewife is one of the toughest jobs. It requires one to be
   constantly working. However, a lot of people disrespect this work.

   Dr. Satija shared, “It requires 24x7 working hours as they have to take
   care of not only themselves, but also their family members, household,
   and other external needs that are required to run the family smoothly.
   But over time, in many cases, they become the last priority for
   themselves and everybody else in the family comes before them. This can
   have adverse effects.”

Mental Health

   Mental health disorders often go undiagnosed or are discovered too late
   since people talk about them much later because they are reluctant to
   do so. Due to this and the fact that discussing mental health is still
   so taboo in our society, this is one of the leading reasons behind the
   high suicide rate among housewives.

   “This has an adverse effect on both their physical and mental
   well-being. It often leads to chronic stress situations, which can come
   out in the forms of physical stress symptoms like diseases including
   diabetes, thyroid, and back pain as well as mental health disorders
   like anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc.,” said Satija.

How Many People Reach Out For Help?

   Talking about mental health issues is still a big taboo topic in India.
   According to a survey by UNICEF, only 41% of young people in India
   between 15 to 24 years of age said that it is good to get support for
   mental health problems.

   According to the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16, nearly 10.7% of
   the Indian population suffered from a mental health illness, with the
   treatment at more than 80% across states. The actual numbers could be
   much more than that as most cases get unreported.

   In 2017, former president Ram Nath Kovind said that India was facing a
   possible ‘mental health epidemic’. He said, “India does not simply have
   a mental health challenge... it is facing a possible mental health
   epidemic.”

   He also mentioned that on the NIMHANS's mental health survey, the
   findings were alarming as 10% of Indians have one or more mental health
   problems.

Social Issues

   Reports indicate that the proportion of female victims faced more
   ‘marriage-related’ issues like dowry, allegations of impotence or
   infertility.

   Dowry, in which an amount of money or property is given by the bride’s
   family to the groom, is a major issue in India. In many dowry-related
   cases, brides are often tortured by the groom and his family for not
   bringing enough money, leading some women to die by suicide suicide to
   escape the constant torture.

   The same is in the case of infertility-related situations. Women are
   subjected to torment for not being able to birth a family heir, and
   eventually, they end up killing themselves.

Unhappy marriages

   Another big reason for such a high number of housewife suicide cases is
   that they get stuck in unhappy marriages. In a conversation with BBC,
   Dr Vikram Patel, a leading Goa-based psychiatrist and professor at the
   London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that “Many women
   face arranged marriages by force. They have dreams and aspirations, but
   they often do not get supportive spouses. Sometimes their parents don't
   support them either. They are trapped in a difficult system and social
   milieu”.

Rise In Divorce Cases

   Over the years, the number of couples heading for divorce through
   mutual consent has gone up significantly. According to Deccan Herald,
   the number of divorce cases went from 0.50 per 1,000 marriages in 1988
   to 13 per 1,000 in 2019.

   According to a study by anthropologist Sreeparna Chattopadhyay and
   economist Suraj Jacob, 0.11% of our population is divorced, and almost
   three times as many people are separated (0.29%).

   According to several media reports, a spike in divorce cases was seen
   during the days of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

Why Women Don't End Their Bad Marriage

   Why Some Women Don't End Their Bad Marriage

   Dr. Satija points out four reasons as to why many housewives don't
   leave an unhappy marriage:

Can't Identify Themselves Alone

   Divorce is difficult in our society. Especially for women, who are
   mostly financially reliant and have been caring for someone else's
   family for a very long time. This is because after being with a family
   for a long time, they start to identify themselves as a part of it and
   eventually lose their own sense of self. So, leaving a bad marriage
   involves more than just looking for a better place to live or financial
   security; it also involves finding out what life is beyond this family
   and who this person is if they are not the housewife. So divorce is a
   complex issue on a personal level.

Judgement Of Society

   Society also makes it very difficult to take this step because of all
   the stigmas associated with divorce. It carries with it harsh
   judgements that some women are afraid to face because they haven’t been
   provided with the tools to do so.

The Feeling Of Helplessness

   They have a sense of helplessness because of not being independent and
   self-sufficient and not having any support. This makes the choice to
   walk away much more challenging.

Guilt When Children Are Involved

   It can be challenging for women to file for divorce when there are
   children involved because they feel guilty about putting the child
   through hardship due to the divorce. They get concerned about the
   effects it might have on their child and how the child will be raised
   in the future.

   So, the decision of divorce is often based on more than just how the
   woman feels about the husband or about the marriage;

   However, actually staying in an unhappy marriage just for the sake of
   the children can cause more harm to them than leaving the volatile
   situation.

Effects On Children Of Parents In Unhappy Marriages

   “Divorce is difficult for anyone to handle, especially for children.
   However, several studies show that it is better if the child stays in a
   happy home with a single parent rather than being in an unhappy home
   where both the parents are constantly fighting with each other or
   disrespecting each other,” said Dr Satija. She added, “This is because
   the long-term trauma of being in an unhappy family has major
   consequences.”

Effect Of A Mother's Suicide On The Children

   Dr Satija discussed the impact a mother's suicide had on the children.
   She said, "When a person dies by suicide, it impacts society on
   multiple levels. It is difficult for the close family to accept that
   someone has gone through this, and when the child sees their parent
   dying by suicide, especially the mothers, who are often the primary
   caregivers in the family in most cases, it shakes them.”

   She added, “The trauma is not just about dealing with it or a temporary
   response, but it changes one's brain in multiple ways.”

   She also discussed the potential long-term effects on children. "Having
   such a traumatic incident at a young age typically leads to the biology
   of the brain to be impacted. Traumatic thought patterns can develop.
   They may grow up not being able to trust relationships, not being able
   to find hope in life, and not being able to get past the incident," she
   said.

   Dr Satija mentioned common mental health disorders observed in such
   cases. According to her, PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder),
   depression,  anxiety disorder, and addictions are the most common
   conditions found in people, who have had a parent who died by suicide.

Places With The Most Housewife Suicide Cases

   According to data from the NCRB, the majority of suicides by housewives
   were reported in Tamil Nadu (3,221 out of 23,179 suicides), followed by
   Madhya Pradesh (3,055 out of 23,179 suicides), and Maharashtra (2,861
   out of 23,179 suicides), which together accounted for 13.9%, 13.2%, and
   12.3% of all such suicides in 2021.

‘I feel like a 1950s housewife’: how lockdown has exposed the gender divide

   It’s still expected that women will make their jobs fit around

   During the lockdown, Anna Bosworth, a freelance marketing consultant,
   has given up on her career so that her husband can concentrate on his.
   “There isn’t a second I can work, from 5am until my kids go to sleep at
   8.30pm,” she says. “I can’t do anything productive.”

   Like many working mothers, Bosworth is self-employed and went part-time
   after she had her first child. Meanwhile, her husband has a full-time
   job at an advertising agency. He is continuing to work normally, except
   for one day a week which he is taking as holiday. “He’s doing
   everything to help with the children, but I feel lucky he still has a
   job,” says Bosworth. “The priority for us is to keep our house and pay
   our bills, and his job is the most straightforward route to that.”

   They have an eight-month-old baby and a five-year-old girl, and
   normally get help from grandparents and a childminder so that they can
   both work. “I’m a feminist and believe in choice,” she says. “But
   because of the pandemic, my choices have been taken away. I feel like a
   1950s housewife.”

   She is not alone. During the lockdown, mothers in the UK are typically
   providing at least 50% more childcare as well as spending around 10% to
   30% more time than fathers home schooling their children, figures
   analysed by the Observer show.

   It doesn’t matter whether a woman is working from home, working outside
   the home or not working at all: the research reveals she is typically
   spending at least an extra hour-and-a-half on childcare and home
   schooling every day, compared to the average man in the same
   circumstances.

   The research, carried out by economists from the universities of
   Cambridge, Oxford and Zurich between 9 and 14 April, indicates that a
   woman who is at home – whether or not she is formally working – is
   affected by this gender divide. Both employed and unemployed mothers
   are typically spending around six hours providing childcare and home
   schooling every working day. By contrast, the average father at home is
   only spending a little over four hours on childcare and homeschooling
   each working day, regardless of his employment status.

   “Whatever situation you have, on average it’s the woman doing more, and
   it’s not because she’s working less” says Dr Christopher Rauh, an
   economist at Cambridge University.

     Men seem to be able to lock themselves away in a study, while women
     are working at the kitchen table – and also trying to home educate

   Mary-Ann Stephenson, Women's Budget Group

   The gender divide is even larger in high-income households. A mother
   who earns over £80,000 and is working from home is typically doing 3.3
   hours of home schooling and 3.8 hours of childcare each day – over
   seven hours in total. A typical father who earns over £80,000 only
   spends 2.1 hours home schooling his children and 2.3 hours on childcare
   each working day – less than 4.5 hours in total.

   “The higher the household income, the more time women are spending home
   schooling compared to men,” says Rauh. “People come up with
   explanations – like women are better at taking care of their children
   due to evolution – but if that were true, it shouldn’t apply to home
   schooling. Yet we also see those differences here.”

   The amount of home schooling children are receiving in lockdown appears
   to be particularly affected by the income of their mothers, with the
   lowest-paid women spending 2.1 hours a day educating their children
   each day (over an hour less than the highest-paid women). Fathers
   earning £0 to £20,000 are doing even less homeschooling (1.9 hours),
   but that’s still roughly the same as the higher-paid men.

   The starkest gender divide among low-paid parents, however, is around
   childcare. Like the highest-paid women, those women earning £0 to
   £20,000 are doing 3.9 hours of childcare each day. By contrast, the
   lowest-paid men are carrying out just 2.4 hours of childcare each day.

   In other words, a woman earning over £80,000 and working from home is
   typically spending 60% more time (an extra 1.4 hours) on childcare each
   working day than the average man earning £0 to £20,000.

   Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Women’s Budget Group, thinks this
   may be because women are more used to having to juggle looking after
   children and work than men. “It may be that in an emergency the woman
   takes on more of the childcare work,” she says.

   Children may also be more inclined to go to their mothers than their
   fathers, she says. Similarly, if their father is paid more, it might be
   seen as more important that he doesn’t lose his job.

   The home-learning platform Atom Learning says that since the lockdown
   began, more than three-quarters of parents who have registered their
   children for free online lessons and set them schoolwork were female.

   At the same time, there is evidence that women’s contributions outside
   the home are decreasing. There has been a drop in the number of
   solo-authored academic papers submitted by women, while submissions by
   male academics have increased. Similarly, at the Philosophy Foundation,
   the majority of the organisation’s work is now being carried out by
   men. “This is because most of our female philosophers are having to
   focus on childcare and home education” says co-CEO Emma Worley.

   Working Families, which runs a legal advice service for parents and
   carers, has seen a sixfold increase in inquiries since the lockdown
   began, 80% of which have come from women. “We have seen evidence from
   mothers that they’re being penalised and not being supported to work
   from home because they have children. We’ve also seen mothers having to
   take unpaid leave or being dismissed.”

   There are concerns about the impact of all this on women’s mental
   health. Research from King’s College London shows that, since the
   lockdown began, 57% of women say they are feeling more anxious and
   depressed, compared to only 40% of men. More women than men also report
   that they are getting less sleep, and eating less healthily, than
   usual.

   “In a large number of cases, women are doing the vast majority of the
   caring for small children and the home educating work,” says
   Stephenson. “The men seem to be able to lock themselves away in a
   study, while the women are working at the kitchen table – and also
   trying to home-educate”

   Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, says the wider
   implications of the lockdown gender divide are clear. “This shows that
   the default assumptions about who does the caring for children
   fundamentally haven’t shifted. It defaults to women. There’s still an
   expectation that women will make their jobs fit around the caring,
   whereas a man’s job will come first.”

‘You don’t feel like you’re performing 100%’

   Lizzie Harrop and her son, Barnaby, aged 5.
   Lizzie Harrop and her son, Barnaby, aged 5.

   In lockdown, Lizzie Harrop had been experiencing the same anxiety
   levels she felt when she was suffering from postnatal depression five
   years ago. “In the beginning, my child was making me feel like a
   prisoner again. I was trapped in my own home, with responsibility for a
   five-year-old and a huge pressure to teach him, but I had a job to do
   as well.”

   She works full-time in a senior role at a well-known company – and for
   the first week was having to conduct almost every single meeting with
   her son, Barnaby, on her knee. “I called him my shadow. He was very
   excited about having me around all the time. But it was relentless,
   seven days a week.”

   Her stress levels rose. “Even though the business was being brilliant
   around not expecting parents with children at home to do all their
   usual hours, as a hardworking person you don’t feel like you’re
   performing 100%. As a consequence, you feel like you’re failing. And
   failing is just a shit place to be.”

   She and her husband both work full-time and earn equal salaries. “But
   if I am at home, my child will always migrate to me –and that’s a
   bloody nightmare.”

   She began to argue with her husband about whose job was more important,
   resulting in some major rows. “There were moments when we were like:
   we’re probably not going to make it through this lockdown together. We
   had a couple of really difficult conversations.”

   But now, she says, they are in “a really good place”. The key change
   was deciding to “own” her situation in lockdown. “You’ve got to boss
   it. You can’t let it boss you.”

   That’s where the framework came in: a shared calendar that shows who is
   the primary carer for their son every minute of the day from 6am until
   bedtime, with each parent expected to do equal amounts of childcare and
   home schooling during that period, ideally in scheduled three-hour
   chunks. The timing of work meetings – and exercise – must be diarised
   and agreed between them, days in advance.

   “What I’ve now observed is that my husband is brilliant with Barnaby,
   who has turned into a different, more confident boy with both of us
   being there for him at home. And as a couple, we’ve gotten much closer
   together. I think we had to have a rocky bit to come out the other
   side.”

The Stress of Being a Housewife

   4 minutes
   The Stress of Being a Housewife The Stress of Being a Housewife

   Last update: 27 April, 2020

   We could devote hundreds of pages to the topic of stress itself.
   However, there are some people who are especially susceptible to the
   effects of stress. In this case, we’re talking about housewives.

   We may think that the role of a housewife doesn’t involve pressure
   since it’s a common occupation. However, this isn’t the case.
   Housewives actually do a lot of tasks.

   If we consider intensive work, high level of responsibility, and lack
   of leisure time causes of stress, then being a housewife is definitely
   a stressful occupation. This means that a housewife may be exposed to a
   lot of stressors.

The housewife: a superwoman with superpowers

   The primary responsibility of a housewife is to care for her family and
   her home. Her obligations demand physical and mental stress.

   Regarding physical stress, it may not be too intense. However, it may
   be continuous, with few breaks, which may lead to faster deterioration.
   Housewives are physically exerted throughout the day. They don’t have
   schedules. From the time they wake up until they go to bed, they have
   to be active in order to fulfill their family’s needs. From personal
   care to nutrition, the housewife takes on all the work. The
   responsibility of caring for a dependent family member rests on the
   mother.

   At the same time, housewives have to maintain order and cleanliness in
   their homes. This activity is never-ending because they have to do it
   every day. Moreover, what’s worse is the feeling of being useless
   because of the routinary nature of the work. Arranging things for
   nothing and then arranging them again tomorrow.

The housewife has to exert continuous physical effort

   The physical effort housewives make tend to be more routinary than
   intensity. However, some people may suppose (and for good reason) that
   they also exert themselves physically. They have to move furniture,
   carry heavy bags, carry a child in their arms…

   It may be true that a housewife has some time to take a break. She can
   sleep throughout the night. But can she really take a break or sleep?
   The housewife must remain alert day or night for any unforeseen
   situation, especially if she has small children who cry, demand things,
   or get sick.

   All this physical exertion leads to fatigue. This fatigue leads to
   muscular fatigue and exhaustion. The stress of being a housewife is
   made up of these factors.

Mental activity results in the stress of being a housewife

   People believe that a housewife’s activities don’t involve mental work.
   However, this isn’t true. She must prepare the menu, calculate
   expenses, solve her children’s problems, etc. She has to face many
   diverse challenges.

   Many professions, like engineers, lawyers, project designers, or air
   traffic controllers, involve mental exhaustion. However, if we delve
   deeper into this, these professions are no different from being a
   housewife. Both undertake important tasks such as planning, resource
   management, or communicative intelligence.

   On the other hand, mental exertion may lead to mental fatigue. This
   diminishes her capacity for concentration, contributing to emotional
   instability. Therefore, the stress of being a housewife is heightened
   by her exposure to mental exertion.

The housewife also has a life of her own

   A housewife is, first of all, a person. She has her own conflicts,
   feelings, and psychological intricacies. What would happen if the
   housewife suffered from other types of stress, aside from the stress
   that comes from being a housewife?

   We think that nowadays, many housewives, besides carrying the entire
   burden of their homes, also work outside the home. That is, we’re
   talking about people who take on two full-time jobs, with little or no
   help at all. The worse part of all is that many of these women are
   misunderstood.

   Being a housewife is a dull job, who many women who never receive the
   recognition they should, do. This feeling of being unimportant often
   acts as a catalyst for stress, triggering the feeling of loneliness and
   isolation between the walls of the housewife’s home.

   Sometimes families stress us out. There are moments when the roots of
   our family tree trap us by the feet and won't let us go.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Being a Housewife

   The advantages and disadvantages of being a housewife are described
   here in this article. Before coming to the advantages and disadvantages
   let us know in detail what housewife means.  A woman who stays at home
   to take care of her home and family is known as housewife. Everyone has
   their unique ideas related to this topic as for someone being housewife
   is a cakewalk and for some other it is difficult to be a housewife. As
   a coin as both sides like that being a housewife has its own advantages
   and disadvantages. Let us get into detail.

Advantages of being a housewife

   The advantages of being a housewife are described below in detail:

1. Keeping an eye on children and taking care of home

   If both the partners are busy in their professional lives there is no
   scope to take care of their home and children as there is any time for
   them. One has to be very responsible and should take care of one’s
   children. Due to this they have to depend on other people to take care
   of their kids and home and they cannot keep an eye on what is happening
   in the home. Being a housewife she can closely watch and monitor her
   kids this will increase bonding between the kids and her. Thus she can
   completely enjoy her motherhood by watching her kids growing which is
   not possible for a working woman. As she is a home keeper she will
   maintain their home neat and hygiene. There is no wastage of money also
   as there is no need to hire a maid.

2. Flexibility

   Housewife has a flexibility to do daily household chores or anything
   else as she wishes to do. There is no particular order in doing her
   works. As there are no deadlines or stress in doing work like job
   holders she has mental peace in doing her work. As she is not
   answerable to any one on what to do or how to do she does whatever she
   likes to do in her own way.

3. Management of time

   Being a housewife one can utilize their time wisely and use their
   leisure time for increasing her skills. Although she is doing
   everyone’s work in the house she can manage to have her own time which
   is lack in some working women’s.  In leisure time she can do work from
   home jobs, learn new things, explore her interests, and do her favorite
   things etc.., all these cannot be possible to do for a working woman as
   she has no time to come up with her interests. And while we compare
   housewife and working woman housewife work for almost 5-6 hours a day
   whereas working woman has to work for 8-10 hours depending on their job
   nature by this we can say that housewife feel less tired than a working
   woman.

4. Housewife is herself a Boss and maid too

   Housewife has a freedom to do things. For example if she wants to
   rearrange things in her home she can do according to her taste as she
   is her own boss. And at the end of the day she was appreciated for all
   the sacrifice she was doing to the family. Being a housewife is plays
   both the roles of a boss and a maid which give her satisfaction.

5. Family matters most

   For a woman who is housewife for her family matters most. It is
   advantage for the family members as she takes care of everyone in the
   family.  She will be there for everyone in her family. It is a boon for
   some people to have a partner who is housewife. In her point of view
   being a housewife makes her enable to take care of herself too like she
   can take care her skin, hair etc., as she has time to maintain but it
   is not possible to maintain everything careful for a working women like
   a housewife.

Disadvantages of being a housewife

   The disadvantages of being a housewife are described below in detail:

1. Service taken for granted

   The work done by a housewife is taken for granted by everyone in the
   house.  There is no appreciation or recognisation of her hard work
   through the day.  Her decision is not taken in financial matters or
   some other important matters as she is consider as that she doesn’t
   know anything about such matters. She is treated as an orthodox or
   superstitious person.

2. No financial stability

   There is no financial independence for housewife. For everything she
   has to depend on her husband. This will cause some disturbances and
   upset her. Unlike working woman if she wants to buy anything or wants
   to give gifts to her loved ones or for herself she has to again ask
   money which she feels bad and insecure. And if family is facing some
   serious financial issues housewife cannot able to help them.

3. No Professional Life

   Housewife doesn’t have a Professional life. She may be get bored of
   doing same daily household chores. She is less explored to outer world
   and she may not be able to experience the work life which gives some
   kind of self satisfaction. Sometimes she may get vexed of doing all
   this without having a personal life or professional life which is not
   good. These are little things which can give joy and fulfillment of
   life. There is a great life with proper utilization of one’s skills in
   a productive way as the skills of housewife are not getting into
   limelight all her skills will be wasted if she doesn’t concentrate.

4. Restrictions

   She has to take permission to do a new thing if she wants to do. Like
   if she wants to learn a new course she has to take permission and ask
   for money. She always cannot do things which she likes to do. Sometimes
   she has to change her tastes according to her family members.

5. Psychological imbalances

   As housewife don’t care of herself and she ignores her health and
   changes in physical and mental conditions her body tends to change
   easily. She gains weight. And an idle mind generates many evil thoughts
   which are not good to her. The life of housewife is boring and
   depressing in this point of view.

   THIS year marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of Ann Oakley’s
   Housewife.

   Based on Oakley’s PhD research, the pioneering feminist book looks at
   the role of the housewife in modern industrialised society.

   “The study of domestic labour was not taken seriously at all — it
   wasn’t understood to be a topic, in fact,” Oakley tells me as we sit in
   her office at the Institute for Education in London where she is
   professor of sociology and social policy.

   During her research, Oakley, now 70, interviewed 40 women living in
   suburban London. She found they tended to be dissatisfied because of
   the monotony, fragmentation and social isolation inherent in the role
   of housewife.

   Therefore, as “housework is directly opposed to the possibility of
   human self-actualisation,” she concluded with a call to abolish the
   housewife role.

   “I was being deliberately provocative,” she explains about the book’s
   final chapter which also called for the abolition of the traditional
   family and the abolition of traditional gender roles.

   Four decades later, what’s changed?

   “I think the whole notion of women being housewives has changed,” she
   replies.

   “If you asked women now to talk about themselves as housewives they
   wouldn’t know what you were talking about really.”

   But while she concedes men do more housework today, she explains it’s
   still not equal.

   “I don’t think there is any study in the world which shows it’s equal.”

   Sure enough, in the newly published 2014 Global Trends survey, 70 per
   cent of British women said they are mostly responsible for cooking,
   food shopping and household cleaning.

   These findings are supported by research from the Organisation for
   Economic Co-operation and Development (2013) and the Institute for
   Public Policy Research (2012), both of which show British women still
   do the lion’s share of domestic labour.

   “Most of the change that has happened since the ’70s has been, in my
   view, fairly superficial,” Oakley says.

   “The change in behaviour is probably less than the professed attitude —
   what people say is more egalitarian than what they do.”

   In particular, Oakley’s 1970s research was interested in the inequality
   of responsibility.

   “In so far as men did housework it was construed by the men and women
   as him helping her with the housework — not the other way round.

   “In terms of the issue of responsibility, what happened in the 1970s is
   still happening now.”

   When men do pitch in, studies show they generally end up doing the
   tasks that are arguably more enjoyable and leisurely — gardening and
   DIY, for example.

   Oakley agrees. “In the area of childcare, it’s still the case that men
   are more likely to be doing the more enjoyable side of childcare,
   rather than changing the dirty nappies.”

   So why does this grossly unfair status quo continue?

   “Patriarchy is the simple explanation,” Oakley argues.

   “Men are a privileged group and there is no reason they should give up
   their privilege unless they are forced to do so.” This is where
   feminism comes in. “Most of the change in men’s behaviour, I suspect,
   has come about because the women they are involved with have put
   pressure on them to change. Men haven’t, en masse, decided that
   housework is a good thing to do.”

   Oakley sees increasing men’s involvement in housework and childcare as
   an important step in addressing the social problem of masculinity — a
   topic she explored in a 2011 Guardian article co-written with fellow
   feminist academic Cynthia Cockburn.

   Quoting government statistics, they noted: “Men were perpetrators in 91
   per cent of all violent incidents in England and Wales … 81 per cent
   for domestic violence, 86 per cent for assault, 94 per cent for
   wounding, 96 per cent for mugging, 98 per cent for robbery.”

   In addition, Ministry of Justice figures show men to be responsible for
   98 per cent of sexual offences, 92 per cent of drug offences and 89 per
   cent of criminal damage.

   “The evidence is that being involved in basic care work, being involved
   in very close relationships with dependent people including children,
   is something that brings out qualities which are traditionally
   associated with being a woman — caring, altruism and all that,” Oakley
   says.

   “That happens with men too, but they have to first of all be willing to
   put themselves in the position so those changes can occur.”

   According to 2011 research by Churchill Home Insurers, one in seven of
   the population pay for outside hired help to do housework. Oakley
   doesn’t buy this as a solution to the problem.

   “That’s not a solution because very often the people who are hired are
   women and they are underpaid, their job conditions and security are not
   good,” she says.

   “And usually it is the woman in the household who is responsible for
   looking after the hired help. So you’ve simply passed the oppression on
   in some sense.”

   Oakley’s politics and research interests were energised by the
   second-wave feminism of the early 1970s.

   Forty years later, many commentators argue we are currently in the
   midst of fourth-wave feminism, with groups and campaigns such as UK
   Feminista, Everyday Sexism and No More Page 3 evidence of renewed
   feminist activism.

   “I don’t know enough about it really,” Oakley admits when I ask her
   about the resurgent movement.

   However, she feels that some of the media discussions around
   contemporary feminism she is aware of have little in common with the
   women’s liberation movement of the ’70s.

   She points to the current focus on the representation of women in
   positions of power. “We were not arguing for women’s share of the top
   jobs. We were talking about basic issues, we were arguing on the level
   of basic reproductive rights and access to childcare — state-provided
   childcare. It was all about doing something about the domestic
   oppression and not about undoing the privilege at the top.”

   Rather than getting a bigger portion of the pie, she argues, “it was
   about changing the pie. We wanted a different kind of pie.”

   She is philosophical when I suggest that her work, and the work of many
   other feminists from her generation, is rarely cited in the popular
   feminist polemics being published today.

   “Time moves on — it’s one of the sad things that so much has to be
   rediscovered time and again,” she says.

   In fact she says she found one book that referred to her as dead — “The
   late Ann Oakley.”

   “I’m not late in the sense I’m dead and also I’m quite a punctual
   person,” she quips.

   Having read Housewife and Oakley’s stupendously good Gender and Planet
   Earth — a book that moves from men and meat-eating to critiquing
   post-modernism — I can safely say contemporary feminism is missing a
   lot by ignoring Oakley’s groundbreaking work.

   As the recent surveys mentioned above show, housework continues to be a
   source of inequality between men and women.

   Housewife could therefore be the key text in the revival of feminist
   concern over housework that must take place if women are to gain any
   semblance of equality in the future.
