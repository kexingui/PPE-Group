   Question: I am a married woman. I am regretting getting married a lot.
   This is because my husband does not do any household work. Even after
   eating food, he does not even lift his plate. However, I have no
   problem with them doing their job. I want to be a good housewife, but I
   also have a small child to take care of, which makes me very tired.
   On the other hand, even after seeing my condition, my husband does not
   feel any pity for me. Whenever I ask him for some work, he starts
   making excuses about his job. He doesn’t care about any household
   responsibilities. This is also one of the reasons why I have started
   feeling like her maidservant. I do not know what to do? But to tell the
   truth, if everything continues like this, then I will go mad. (All

Expert Answer

   Relationship coach and founder of Predictions for Success Vishal
   Bhardwaj says that taking care of the household is not a single
   person’s job, especially in nuclear families. This is because a
   housewife struggles a lot during this time.

   This is also one of the reasons that if she does not get the support of
   her partner, she not only gets very tired mentally but the burden of
   physical work also falls on her. In such a situation, she not only
   becomes a victim of severe depression but also suffers from lack of
   self-confidence and sleep related problems.

get used to their help

   As you told that your husband does not even lift his plate after
   eating. In such a situation, I would advise you to start defining your
   work. Not only this, also start taking help of your partner to complete
   those tasks which he can easily do.

   For example, if you like to cook well, you can take their help in
   chopping vegetables. This will not only create a feeling of love
   between the two of you but things will also start getting better soon.

   My story: Within 7 months of marriage, my wife made my life difficult,
   I do not understand what sin I have committed

talk to husband

   On this topic, relationship expert Nidhi Behl Vats says that the best
   thing is that you understand that both of you have to play equal roles
   to make your marriage work. This is because many times men dominate
   their wives and refuse to work, after which women take care of the
   family alone. So I would say that you have won half the battle.

   But even after this you have to maintain a balance with your husband.
   You have to include them in your works. You two can make breakfast
   together. If you want, you can also take their help in preparing lunch.
   Have a healthy conversation with them right there. Tell them how much
   pressure has come on you after the birth of the child.
