   An Australian wife has been attacked by trolls after revealing she
   cooks three meals a day for her husband.

   Sonali Arora started posting videos to TikTok of the meals she makes
   for her husband, Nipun, but was met with backlash from people calling
   her a '1950s housewife' who was 'destroying feminism and women's
   liberation'.

   'If it's not people coming for the portion sizes, it's them attacking
   my husband without even knowing him, calling him a two-year-old, people
   saying that he's misogynistic or I am in the 1950s,' she told FEMAIL.

   The Melbourne newlyweds split the housework '50/50' with Sonali
   enjoying cooking so much she started posting recipes and Nipun's
   lunchboxes to TikTok, however, the abuse soon started flowing.

   'This is satire right?' one viewer asked while another said: 'I don't
   think I have ever packed a lunch for my husband, not his mother'.

   'Being proud of this is my worst nightmare. As they say - Being
   master's favourite dog is still having a master and being a dog,' a
   third harshly replied.

   'Ever heard of the saying 'making a rod for your own back?',' wrote a
   fourth.

   The 26-year-old said while she tries not to let the mean comments get
   to her she's had to delete many hurtful replies.

   'You get a bit defensive about the person you love and especially when
   they're being picked on in the wrong light,' she said.

   Sonali said the assumptions that Nipun is immature or misogynistic
   couldn't be further from the truth and the pair split all the housework
   '50/50'

   'Even though I know they're just complete strangers and what they say
   doesn't define anything, it does still hurt to see.'

   Sonali said the assumptions the online trolls make about their
   relationship couldn't be further from the truth.

   'My husband is the sweetest and most supportive and least misogynistic
   person to ever be on this planet,' she said.

   'We have a really good thing going, we divide all the house chores.
   After I cook he's cleaning dishes, I don't touch that. He also is
   responsible for cleaning all the bathrooms and vacuuming the floors.'

   Sonali, who works in cyber security, said she is very independent and
   career driven and would not have the time to whip up three delicious
   meals a day for Nipun if she wasn't working from home.

   'Cooking is something that I love, that's my love language and
   something that brings me joy. It makes me even happier when I see his
   reaction to the creations that I've put together,' she said

   'Cooking is something that I love, that's my love language and

   reaction to the creations that I've put together,' she said

   'That's what gives me the flexibility to cook him three meals a day. If
   I didn't work from home, it definitely would not be that way at all,'
   she said.

   'Cooking is something that I love, that's my love language and

   Despite the hate, Sonali said she receives just as many, if not more,
   positive responses to her videos and refuses to let the haters stop her
   from sharing her passion.

   'Hell yeah, I'm going to keep posting them! It actually helps a lot of
   people in getting diverse ideas for what they can make throughout the
   day because it is such a difficult thing to think about,' she said.

   'It's nice that I've tapped in this community of people who are food
   lovers.'
