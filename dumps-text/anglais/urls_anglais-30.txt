mothers - but others say it's 'common sense' to work and admit they'd be

   A woman has sparked an online debate after saying stay at home wives
   and mothers are often the target of vitriol - prompting some to say
   they would be 'devastated' if their offspring chose not to work.

   The anonymous, UK-based poster took to parenting forum Mumsnet to
   garner opinions on the divisive topic by sharing a post titled [Am I
   being unreasonable] to not understand the nastiness that being a
   housewife provokes.

   She wrote: 'Not just on Mumsnet. I don't even use Mumsnet that often
   but I see this on other social media websites too.

   'If a woman shares something positive about being a housewife it's full
   of comments about how "being controlled by a man, couldn't be me!" "No
   thanks, I love my independence" or "just wait until he leaves you, then
   what".

   The poster noted that she was curious about attitudes towards both stay
   at home mothers and wives, despite many having different feelings about
   those who stay home without children to care for

   'If a woman shares something negative about it its "see, this is why
   being a housewife is TERRIBLE" (yet no one would say "this is why
   having a career is terrible!" If a person was complaining about their
   job).

   'I saw someone earlier say they'd be devastated if their daughter
   wanted to be a stay-at-home mother.

   'Why does it provoke such vitriol? Other women choosing this doesn't
   force anyone else to, I don't get the complete lack of respect for
   people's decisions and lack of understanding that different people
   enjoy different things.'

   The post sparked a mixed response, with a number of forum users
   questioning the assertion that stay-at-home women and mothers are the
   recipients of such vitriol, with some noting that working mothers are
   also criticised.

   Several forum users questioned whether stay at home wives and mothers
   are subject to such vitriol, while others suggested women face
   judgement whatever their choices

   One wrote: 'Who is being nasty? There are more posts complaining about
   the nastiness than the nasty posts themselves?'

   Another added: 'I have mainly been a SAHP/housewife for the last 25
   years and have never received any funny comments from people. My DH was
   fortunate to be able to retire at 55 and now neither of us work.'

   And a third said: 'I haven’t seen much of that - and what there is is
   counterbalanced by the ‘oh it’s so awful to put your kids in nursery’
   stuff. lots of people are SAHM at least for a couple years so it can’t
   be seen as that peculiar.'

   However, some agreed, suggested that the poster was right, and that
   those who stay at home - either as wives or parents - often are
   criticised.

   Several posters suggested that people criticise the idea of being a
   housewife or stay at home mother because they are jealous

   One wrote: 'I have no idea why people can be nasty about SAHMs and
   housewives either.

   'Theres probably lots of reasons. Maybe jealousy about not having the
   choice, maybe a lack of trust in men in general (e.g. if youve been
   previously cheated on, or product of separated parents etc), maybe
   having worked hard to get to a certain place at work and not
   understanding how anyone might decide to give that up for
   kids/housework etc.'

   Another said: 'Apparently I'm both a terrible person and a victim for
   being a housewife/SAHM. I do everything for my husband including laying
   out his clothes in the morning and preparing all his meals. He rarely
   cooks or cleans but has a list of jobs I can't do that he does. But
   apparently I'm being abused by him. I chose and still choose this life!
   And I get to spend his money in return.

   'I find the people most upset are usually the bitter ones who want to
   be traditional but can't/won't.'

   And a third simply said: 'It's jealousy (but they’ll never admit
   it).'

   A number of respondents admitted they would be devastated if their
   offspring chose not to work, and instead be dependent on a partner

   Others suggested that a lot of negativity around women staying at home
   was likely to be coming from a place of concern around such people
   being reliant on their partners, and missing out on the potential
   fulfilment of working.

   One admitted: 'I voted that you are not being unreasonable, but I would
   be devastated if my daughter wanted to be a housewife. Kids are young
   for such a short time and e benefit from socialization. In addition,
   work can be so satisfying and affirming. I was able to work part-time
   when my kids were little and then full-time. My husband was a high
   earner and he left me after 16 years of marriage. I think I would have
   died if I did not have the support, routine, and continuity of work,
   never mind the pension it allowed me to save. In the modem world sahm
   make themselves extremely vulnerable.'

   Another added: 'The way you're describing it is over the top and I
   agree each to their own but I agree with the poster who said she'd be
   devastated if her daughter chose that path. It's a path I would never
   consider for myself either. Only because living on someone else's whim
   fills me with dread.'

   And a third wrote: 'If my kids remain healthy, I would hate for them to
   be financially dependent on a partner. I hope neither my son nor
   daughter end up as sahps. I also think it’s a sexist construct as there
   are still way more sahms than sahds. It contributes to the gender pay
   gap and inequality which I hate. It’s a hugely vulnerable position in
   the long term, however much protection people think they have put in
   place.

   'On an individual basis, I get why some people end up having to choose
   the sah role. And I love my sahm friends as much as those who work. My
   opposition to the sahm role is nothing personal.'
