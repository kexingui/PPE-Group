Why Are Suicide Cases On The Rise Among Housewives?

   housewife suicide cases

   To learn the cause of the consistently high cases of suicide among
   housewives, we spoke with Dr. Ruhi Satija, a consultant psychiatrist
   and counselling therapist at cloud nine hospitals.

   She spoke about the various challenges women have to face as
   homemakers, which could be contributing factors.

Being A Housewife Is A Hard Job

   Becoming a housewife is one of the toughest jobs. It requires one to be
   constantly working. However, a lot of people disrespect this work.

   Dr. Satija shared, “It requires 24x7 working hours as they have to take
   care of not only themselves, but also their family members, household,
   and other external needs that are required to run the family smoothly.
   But over time, in many cases, they become the last priority for
   themselves and everybody else in the family comes before them. This can
   have adverse effects.”

Mental Health

   Mental health disorders often go undiagnosed or are discovered too late
   since people talk about them much later because they are reluctant to
   do so. Due to this and the fact that discussing mental health is still
   so taboo in our society, this is one of the leading reasons behind the
   high suicide rate among housewives.

   “This has an adverse effect on both their physical and mental
   well-being. It often leads to chronic stress situations, which can come
   out in the forms of physical stress symptoms like diseases including
   diabetes, thyroid, and back pain as well as mental health disorders
   like anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc.,” said Satija.

How Many People Reach Out For Help?

   Talking about mental health issues is still a big taboo topic in India.
   According to a survey by UNICEF, only 41% of young people in India
   between 15 to 24 years of age said that it is good to get support for
   mental health problems.

   According to the National Mental Health Survey 2015-16, nearly 10.7% of
   the Indian population suffered from a mental health illness, with the
   treatment at more than 80% across states. The actual numbers could be
   much more than that as most cases get unreported.

   In 2017, former president Ram Nath Kovind said that India was facing a
   possible ‘mental health epidemic’. He said, “India does not simply have
   a mental health challenge... it is facing a possible mental health
   epidemic.”

   He also mentioned that on the NIMHANS's mental health survey, the
   findings were alarming as 10% of Indians have one or more mental health
   problems.

Social Issues

   Reports indicate that the proportion of female victims faced more
   ‘marriage-related’ issues like dowry, allegations of impotence or
   infertility.

   Dowry, in which an amount of money or property is given by the bride’s
   family to the groom, is a major issue in India. In many dowry-related
   cases, brides are often tortured by the groom and his family for not
   bringing enough money, leading some women to die by suicide suicide to
   escape the constant torture.

   The same is in the case of infertility-related situations. Women are
   subjected to torment for not being able to birth a family heir, and
   eventually, they end up killing themselves.

Unhappy marriages

   Another big reason for such a high number of housewife suicide cases is
   that they get stuck in unhappy marriages. In a conversation with BBC,
   Dr Vikram Patel, a leading Goa-based psychiatrist and professor at the
   London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that “Many women
   face arranged marriages by force. They have dreams and aspirations, but
   they often do not get supportive spouses. Sometimes their parents don't
   support them either. They are trapped in a difficult system and social
   milieu”.

Rise In Divorce Cases

   Over the years, the number of couples heading for divorce through
   mutual consent has gone up significantly. According to Deccan Herald,
   the number of divorce cases went from 0.50 per 1,000 marriages in 1988
   to 13 per 1,000 in 2019.

   According to a study by anthropologist Sreeparna Chattopadhyay and
   economist Suraj Jacob, 0.11% of our population is divorced, and almost
   three times as many people are separated (0.29%).

   According to several media reports, a spike in divorce cases was seen
   during the days of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.

Why Women Don't End Their Bad Marriage

   Why Some Women Don't End Their Bad Marriage

   Dr. Satija points out four reasons as to why many housewives don't
   leave an unhappy marriage:

Can't Identify Themselves Alone

   Divorce is difficult in our society. Especially for women, who are
   mostly financially reliant and have been caring for someone else's
   family for a very long time. This is because after being with a family
   for a long time, they start to identify themselves as a part of it and
   eventually lose their own sense of self. So, leaving a bad marriage
   involves more than just looking for a better place to live or financial
   security; it also involves finding out what life is beyond this family
   and who this person is if they are not the housewife. So divorce is a
   complex issue on a personal level.

Judgement Of Society

   Society also makes it very difficult to take this step because of all
   the stigmas associated with divorce. It carries with it harsh
   judgements that some women are afraid to face because they haven’t been
   provided with the tools to do so.

The Feeling Of Helplessness

   They have a sense of helplessness because of not being independent and
   self-sufficient and not having any support. This makes the choice to
   walk away much more challenging.

Guilt When Children Are Involved

   It can be challenging for women to file for divorce when there are
   children involved because they feel guilty about putting the child
   through hardship due to the divorce. They get concerned about the
   effects it might have on their child and how the child will be raised
   in the future.

   So, the decision of divorce is often based on more than just how the
   woman feels about the husband or about the marriage;

   However, actually staying in an unhappy marriage just for the sake of
   the children can cause more harm to them than leaving the volatile
   situation.

Effects On Children Of Parents In Unhappy Marriages

   “Divorce is difficult for anyone to handle, especially for children.
   However, several studies show that it is better if the child stays in a
   happy home with a single parent rather than being in an unhappy home
   where both the parents are constantly fighting with each other or
   disrespecting each other,” said Dr Satija. She added, “This is because
   the long-term trauma of being in an unhappy family has major
   consequences.”

Effect Of A Mother's Suicide On The Children

   Dr Satija discussed the impact a mother's suicide had on the children.
   She said, "When a person dies by suicide, it impacts society on
   multiple levels. It is difficult for the close family to accept that
   someone has gone through this, and when the child sees their parent
   dying by suicide, especially the mothers, who are often the primary
   caregivers in the family in most cases, it shakes them.”

   She added, “The trauma is not just about dealing with it or a temporary
   response, but it changes one's brain in multiple ways.”

   She also discussed the potential long-term effects on children. "Having
   such a traumatic incident at a young age typically leads to the biology
   of the brain to be impacted. Traumatic thought patterns can develop.
   They may grow up not being able to trust relationships, not being able
   to find hope in life, and not being able to get past the incident," she
   said.

   Dr Satija mentioned common mental health disorders observed in such
   cases. According to her, PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder),
   depression,  anxiety disorder, and addictions are the most common
   conditions found in people, who have had a parent who died by suicide.

Places With The Most Housewife Suicide Cases

   According to data from the NCRB, the majority of suicides by housewives
   were reported in Tamil Nadu (3,221 out of 23,179 suicides), followed by
   Madhya Pradesh (3,055 out of 23,179 suicides), and Maharashtra (2,861
   out of 23,179 suicides), which together accounted for 13.9%, 13.2%, and
   12.3% of all such suicides in 2021.
