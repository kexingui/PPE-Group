Working woman versus Housewife

   Money is the only reason to choose a working wife

   The most common misunderstanding among the people, especially among
   those having a materialistic approach, is that a lady working in a
   government department, a private company or a multinational corporation
   is to be regarded as a working woman, whereas a lady who isn’t working
   in such departments or companies, but is doing all the household tasks
   from dusk to dawn tirelessly like cooking, washing, taking care of
   children and many other such jobs, is called a non-working woman or
   housewife.

   Can we call a lady drawing a monthly salary a working woman and the one
   making our life easy, comfortable and pleasant a non-working woman? No
   and absolutely never. If we make a review of the daily routine and
   needs of a home if it is to run smoothly, we come to a conclusion that
   it is a woman who has made it run smoothly and with utmost success.

   After a man has completed his education and also has got a good job in
   the public or private sector, his next priority has always been to
   marry a good girl. Among many criteria fixed by intending grooms for
   choosing a woman as a wife, one of the most important is whether to
   marry a working woman or a stay-at-home housewife. His own choice, the
   wish of his parents and the opinion of his close friends or colleagues
   directly have an impact on his final decision about marrying a working
   woman or a stay-at-home housewife.

   It can be undoubtedly said that the rising inflation and the
   skyrocketing prices of essentials, becoming more expensive with each
   passing day, are compelling today’s youth to look for a match with a
   working woman, but there are certainly other reasons also because of
   which they prefer a working woman over a non-working one. Sometimes a
   government employee or an officer in government department regards it
   as an insult to choose a non-working woman when he finds his own
   friends or colleagues marrying working women. Living a luxurious life,
   having a better standard of life and maximising one’s desires is
   forcing almost every individual to seek ways for a good income from all
   available means. Marrying a working woman is one such means to increase
   one’s income to meet one’s expenses.

   However there is also a good percentage of people who, despite being in
   government service, prefer to marry a non-working woman. For this they
   have their own reasons and aspirations. For a good service at home and
   living their own comfortable and stress-free life, they prefer to a
   have a nonworking woman staying at home.

   Though at the time of wedding or choosing one’a life partner, one feels
   delighted to have a working woman for a partner but after some time
   things make one realize that he hasn’t taken a good decision. In a
   joint family, often the situation takes an ugly turn and mostly the
   couple feel worried when the working daughter in-law doesn’t receive a
   good cooperation from her husband’s parents and other in-laws.

   When the lunch, dinner and two times tea for the husband and in-laws
   gets late due to the known reasons of the daughter in-law, everybody in
   the family gets worried and sometimes force the daughter in-law to say
   goodbye to her service.

Due to the over-busy schedule, the working couple faces many problems and
issues both at home as well as outside the home. There is a common saying
that “money can’t buy everything”, so a working couple with a materialistic
mind, intent on making wealth and gathering all luxuries for their life,
always find themselves lamenting in the end.

   A working woman may not be able to manage her children the way they
   should be. After coming back from the school when the children find
   themselves alone in the house and wait for hours together for their
   parents, their personality isn’t developed properly because parents’,
   and especially the mother’s, love, affection and presence is a must in
   the early few years of the child’s growth and development. The strong
   and humanistic fabric of the family gets altogether shattered when
   parents, children and siblings don’t get required time in expressing
   their problems or issues and discussing about the proper way out so
   that each family member doesn’t feel alienated. At many instances it
   has been found that the aged and ailing parents of the working couple
   were either found dead in their own rooms without being noticed by any
   family member or were taken to hospitals by the people other than those
   duty-bound to do so. The social life of the working couple too gets
   affected due to their over-busy schedule. They can’t reach their loved
   ones, near and dear ones or relatives on the specific occasions.

   Due to the over-busy schedule, the working couple faces many problems

   saying that “money can’t buy everything”, so a working couple with a
   materialistic mind, intent on making wealth and gathering all luxuries
   for their life, always find themselves lamenting in the end.

   On the other hand a stay-at-home housewife, who always serves her
   husband with utmost care and honesty, takes care of husband’s ailing
   and aged parents and manages her children with true spirit of a mother,
   is regarded as a successful woman by all in and outside the family. A
   non-working lady can best serve her husband, manage the home and her
   social life too remains intact. The family members of her home, her
   neighbours and relatives unanimously praise her for the extraordinary
   skills she shows in managing the home and taking care of every aspect
   of family life.

   One more important aspect is that the working women often become
   victims of depression and mental trauma while their non-working
   counterparts often live a happy, prosperous and contended life.
