Complete details

   Since July 13, a video has been circulating on Facebook containing the
   claim that solo parents, mothers, and housewives will be given a
   P10,000 monthly allowance from the government.

   This is false.

   As of July 2022, there are no announcements from the national
   government regarding this.

   There have also been no new reports from local governments and
   government agencies regarding any monthly allowance to be given to
   these groups.

   Last June, the Expanded Solo Parents Welfare Act or Republic Act No.
   11861 lapsed into law. The law includes new provisions such as the
   distribution of P1,000 cash subsidy to solo parents whose income is
   below the poverty line and 20% discount on infant formula, diapers,
   medicines, vaccines, and other necessities.

   Rappler has recently debunked multiple claims regarding supposedly new
   cash aid distribution programs by the government that may be found
   here. – Sofia Guanzon/Rappler.com
