   We all know about the glamorous lifestyle that Dubai has and it shows
   clearly on social media, TikToks and Youtube videos as well. Recently,
   lionlindaa posted a TikTok that showed her life as a 23-year-old
   housewife living in Dubai.

   She starts off the video buying a luxurious pair of heels from Saint
   Laurent Paris. It took her quite a while to get her hands on this as
   her size wasn‚Äôt available.

   Then the lady says, ‚ÄúI went to Valentino and I tried on these shoes but
   they were too much of like a grandma. But then I got this clearance
   vial of oil and then I was invited to a really special jewelry showing
   in the Dubai Mall.‚Äù

   Now talking about Jewelry and Dubai we all know everything is expensive
   and she wanted to buy all of them because they were ‚Äúso pretty‚Äù. Her
   favouritie of them costed ‚Äú$300,000‚Äù.

   Then her husband came and they went to Balenciaga and after then to
   Tulum.

   The lady describes it as the best Mexican food I‚Äôve ever had in Dubai.
   It was actually really good.

   Then we can see her husband kissing her hand because she is mad at him.
   He only bought her 2 diamond necklaces instead of four and that‚Äôs it.

   Watch the video here:

   Most viewers in the comment didn‚Äôt understand her satire in the video
   and its description. One of them wrote, ‚ÄúAt least you get 2 üòÖ‚Äù while
   another commented, ‚ÄúHe only got me 2 necklaces instead of 4. And I‚Äôm
   over here struggling to buy my one year old new clothes.‚Äù

   Its funny how some of them were even giving her advice. Tatum wrote, ‚ÄúI
   don‚Äôt get why ppl have to buy name brand things. I mean it‚Äôs just
   clothes..u could find the same style cheaper. The only difference is
   the name..‚Äù
