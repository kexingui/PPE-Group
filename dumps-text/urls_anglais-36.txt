Victim’s parents to receive pension for life

   Peace of mind: Housewife Norhayani Abdul Ghani, 41, doing chores at her
   home in Petaling Jaya. Housewives like her will have better protection
   under the social security scheme. — AZMAN GHANI/The Star

   PETALING JAYA: A new social security scheme for women has been
   welcomed, especially by those who cannot afford to buy personal
   insurance coverage.

   Housewife Visithra Alagan, 42, said that she is looking forward to
   being a part of the Housewives Social Security Scheme (SKSSR) due to
   its affordability.

   “As a B40 family, it is very difficult for us to buy a personal
   insurance policy and pay for it every month as it could be very
   expensive.

   “With this scheme’s one-time payment of RM120 for a whole year, I think
   my husband could easily afford it,” she added.

   Visithra emphasised the importance of the scheme for women like
   herself.

   “I have been injured several times at home, including once when my hand
   was sprained badly while cleaning and I couldn’t go to the doctor due
   to financial constraints.

   “With this scheme, however, I think that many women, particularly
   widows and single mothers who have been injured doing household chores
   and cannot afford treatment due to the high cost, will be able to
   obtain protection,” she said.

   Maimunah Mustapa, 49, said although she does not have full details of
   the scheme, she was eager to register for it, given how she spent much
   of her time alone at home.“I was unaware of it at first, but now that I
   have heard about it, I am curious to learn more because I think it
   would be very beneficial for me.

   “My children live in different states, and my husband works out of town
   frequently, so if anything were to happen, it’s good to know that there
   is a scheme to protect me,” said the housewife.

   Under the SKSSR, husbands can choose to pay the contribution for their
   wives, which amounts to RM120, to the Social Security Organisation
   (Socso) to be protected for 12 months.

   A business manager who only identified herself as Chong said having the
   scheme in place would allow her to carry out household chores with
   peace of mind.

   “Initially, I thought only housewives would benefit from this but
   knowing that working women are also eligible, I am interested in
   registering.

   “It also adds another layer of security for me, seeing how I already
   have personal insurance as well,” said the mother of two.

   Academic assistant K. John, 33, is considering registering his mother
   under the scheme.

   “My mother is active at work and at home.

   “She takes care of the family and enrolling in this scheme would ensure
   she is protected while carrying out household chores,” he said.
