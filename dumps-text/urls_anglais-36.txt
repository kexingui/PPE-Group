‘Don’t Worry Darling’ review: the superficial ode to the modern housewife

   Olivia Wilde’s new psychological thriller, “Don’t Worry Darling,”
   follows the story of a young 1950s couple by the names of Jack (played
   by Harry Styles) and Alice (played by Florence Pugh), who live in a
   desert-based experimental community called Victory. This so-called
   paradise town is revealed to be full of dark secrets as Alice begins to
   see glimpses of a more sinister reality in front of her.

   The film starts with an intriguing set up. Like the rest of the wives
   in this idyllic town, Alice waves goodbye to her husband in the
   cul-de-sac where they reside and returns back inside to clean, playing
   on themes of control and the “Housewife” archetype. She scrubs and
   polishes their home to perfection while humming a tune that circulates
   throughout the movie.

   An eerie metronome-like breathing keeps score of the cracks in Alice’s
   world. What once starts as a windy breath builds up to hyperventilation
   of tones dancing over an ambient piano and signaling to the audience
   the anxiety and unease in Alice’s body. Each breath and tone invites us
   into the stomach of the characters until you too exist within them and
   your heartbeat mirrors theirs

   The film followed a plot that mirrored hints of “Stepford Wives,” “Get
   Out” and “The Truman Show” in a 1950s desert landscape with a familiar
   energy to Darren Aronofsky’s 2010 film, “Black Swan.”

   The film explores the themes of authority, manipulation, power and the
   female experience, playing most notably on the idea of  the fantasy of
   the modern housewife controlled by a system she lacks control over.
   This theme is seen time and time again from the habitual routine of
   Jack and Alice.

   Every morning Jack is greeted with breakfast — sausage, eggs and toast
   — and after returning from work, he is met with a clean house, a
   martini in hand, warm dinner and a perfectly dressed wife eagerly
   waiting to be undressed, yet every day Alice grows more and more weary
   of something below the surface.

   As the plot thickens, what starts as a deliciously citrus veneer soon
   melts into visually haunting imagery that plays off the reappearing
   theme of order. Among everyday objects and tasks in Alice’s life, the
   daily rhythm of life starts to shape-shift into collapsed versions of
   itself and with it, the mental health of our leading lady plummets.

   The film follows the idea of the “feminine mystique” coined in the
   1960s by Betty Friedan with the assumption that women can exist as
   caterers to others, fulfilled by marriage, sex and house work.  The
   theme of the “Doll House” is also present, a concept exploring themes
   similar to the Feminine Mystique, playing off the idea of a greater
   initiator controlling the life of someone deemed “below them”, often
   women, as to create an ideal landscape or “perfect life.”

   I believe most women can relate to the experience of Alice in one way
   or another most profoundly in her role as a support system at the
   expense of her own mental health and as a woman subjected to
   gaslighting in the all too typical “hysterical” sense.

   The theme of the Doll House and the housewife is done in a successful
   manner with the aid of stunning visual elements and an anxiety inducing
   soundtrack, but ultimately lacked a certain level of depth. As the plot
   continued to unfold, it was met with a predictable and overdone reveal
   that did not live up to the other fantastic aspects of the film.

   Ultimately, Pugh was by far the star of the film. Alongside the movie’s
   stunning cinematography, her acting made up for areas where the film
   was lacking.

   In her performance with Harry Styles, Pugh kept the film from drifting
   to novice acting styles despite working with a less seasoned actor.
   Even then, I felt that the electric and evocative talent of Pugh could
   have been better served in a movie that catered more towards her
   talents.

   “Don’t Worry Darling” hit the notes in its visual appeal, artistic
   sequences and phenomenal acting from its lead, but fell short in its
   explanation and in superficial ode to “The Housewife.” As a whole, the
   film could have benefited from a greater exploration into Alice’s
   character and a more unique reveal.

    I would have sacrificed many sequences in the middle and end of the
   film to have more elements of Alice’s life post plot reveal explored.
   Especially as a film dedicated to the breaking down of the Doll House,
   I would have enjoyed a deeper dive into Alice outside of the Barbie
   figure forced upon her.
