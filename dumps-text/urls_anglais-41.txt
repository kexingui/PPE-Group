   The construction of Monkton Cokeworks on the outskirts of Hebburn in
   the mid 1930s was a well-intentioned project.

   Built on former farmland, the sprawling complex provided work for
   hundreds of men at a time of mass unemployment as the Great Depression
   wreaked economic havoc around the world, and especially on Tyneside
   where it spawned the 1936 Jarrow Crusade. But over time, the plant
   became universally regarded as a giant blot on the landscape, pumping
   out continuous smoke and grime and becoming a major environmental and
   health issue for those who lived nearby.

   A newly-published book, Clean Air , tells the story of the rise of
   everyday housewife Jennie Shearan to campaigning environmentalist. It
   was written by her grandson, Gianfranco Rosolia, who was born and
   raised on Tyneside, but currently lives in Los Angeles.

   venue today

   Clean Air relates the story of people who lived on the doorstep of
   Monkton Cokeworks from 1953 to 1990. Their daily reality was a
   nightmare of hazardous and acrid sulphur dioxide emissions,
   all-pervading soot, and clamorous noisy tannoys.

   Over decades, the facility grew unflaggingly, converting
   ever-increasing quantities of coal into coke without concern for the
   residents’ well-being. In forming the Hebburn Residents’ Action Group,
   Jennie Shearan brought together the underrepresented residents of
   Monkton Lane Estate, and gave them a voice, igniting a national
   dialogue about the health risks from the pollution that her
   neighbourhood had to endure.

   While the events in the book took place on South Tyneside over 30 years
   ago, there remains a resonance to the challenges Jennie Shearan had to
   overcome during her campaign for environmental justice. She battled a
   negligent big energy firm that prioritised profit over people,
   governmental bodies that lacked accountability, and institutional
   sexism. She took on all levels of the establishment, from British Coal
   to Margaret Thatcherʼs government, galvanising her underrepresented
   town and bringing her case all the way to the European Parliament.

   Jennie’s grandson, author of Clean Air , Gianfranco Rosolia, says:
   “Throughout her arduous journey, Jennie was brave, steadfast and
   sincere, demonstrating a level of resourcefulness and tenacity that
   would inspire any leader, the capacity to corral a group around a
   single-minded vision that any politician could learn from, and a degree
   of resilience that can energise us all.

   “The book illustrates the countless sacrifices and bold choices that
   Jennie made, the effectiveness of grassroots activism and people power,
   and the beauty of leaving behind a better world for future generations.
   Jennie Shearan and the Hebburn Residents’ Action Group deeply loved
   their community. They put their heart and spirit into improving the
   lives of ordinary people. Their redoubtable efforts left a deeply
   positive and long-lasting legacy, giving thousands of people hope for a
   stronger and healthier future and transforming their quality of life.

   "To continue their good work, all proceeds from CLEAN AIR will go
   directly to three charities that represent what Jennie was fighting
   for: Hebburn Helps , Friends of the Earth , The Environmental Law
   Foundation .”

   The book has received praise from some notable supporters, including
   Geordie rock star Sting who said: “This is an inspirational story about
   female empowerment, grassroots activism and environmental justice. What
   an eloquent spokesperson Jennie Shearan was.”

   Monkton Cokeworks finally closed in 1990 and was demolished two years
   later. Three decades on, the area has been reclaimed as a pleasant
   green space, and its paths are popular with walkers and cyclists.
   Jennie Shearer died aged 82 in 2005.

   Clean Air by Gianfranco Rosolia is available in paperback and ebook
   (both £9.99), and hardcover and audiobook (£15.99). You can buy the
   book directly from the author, or at Amazon or Apple Books. The book is
   available in paperback, hardcover, ebook and audiobook. For further
