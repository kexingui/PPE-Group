What's so bad about being a housewife?

   After reading a recent study that suggests women would rather be
   divorced than doing dishes, Jennifer defends the “traditional” role of
   housewives.

   When I’m in the mood for snark and irreverence, Jezebel never
   disappoints. This week, housewives were under fire with the headline
   “Most Women Would Rather Kick Their Husbands to the Curb Than Be a
   Housewife” catching my attention.

   Highlighting research from Kathleen Gerson’s 2009 book, The Unfinished
   Revolution, Jezebel pokes fun at the 1950s stereotype of a woman who
   stays home while her husband brings home the bacon, calling this
   traditional role “quaint.” After all, doesn’t every woman want to be
   totally equal with her partner? That’s what 80% of women and 70% of men
   want — at least according to Gerson’s research.

   But when Gerson asked study subjects what they would do it they found
   themselves in a relationship where men and women couldn’t sustain an
   equal partnership, 75% of women said they would rather ask their
   husband for a divorce than stay in a marriage that had them home with
   their children. My friend, Chantal, was shocked at the statistic which
   stated that 70% of men who were asked the same question said they hoped
   their wives would “de-prioritize” their career and focus on homemaking.

   Instead of jumping on the bandwagon of saying men don’t care about
   women’s careers — which is what the bulk of commenters wrote on Jezebel
   — I want to flip this statistic around and highlight what depresses me:
   Only 25% of Gerson’s female study subjects would choose their kids over
   their career. To me this study says less about the importance of women
   in the workplace than it does about how little young, unmarried people
   value family.

   Believe me, I didn’t grow up dreaming of being a stay-at-home mom, and
   if I had been part of that same study group 15 years ago I would have
   answered that question the same way. But marriage and children have a
   funny way of changing your priorities and, after having our second
   child, my husband and I decided that the best place for me to be was at
   home — a joint decision based on the fact that his income could support
   this choice and mine could not.

   There are moments in my new life as a housewife that my 20-year-old
   career-minded self would have cringed at, but now, as a stay-at-home
   parent who does most of the cooking and cleaning, I can say confidently
   that divorce is not the option I would choose. But if the misconception
   that a housewife’s role in a marriage is little more than cooking the
   bacon her husband brings home, of course divorce seems more attractive
   to a singleton. Truth is, being a housewife isn’t the same as being an
   unpaid janitor — and to see us as such is insulting. I see myself not
   only as a full-time caregiver to my children but, most importantly, to
   my marriage (I consider chores to be pesky side jobs of what I see as
   the real job of a housewife).

   Here are statistics I’d like to see 15 years from now, should
   initiatives like income splitting and tax breaks be put in place,
   enabling more parents to stay home to care for their marriages and
   children:
     * how children read and sing more often and are more literate
     * how divorce rates will fall
     * how youth crime will be reduced
     * how children eat healthier and have fewer cases of diabetes
     * how children play outside more and obesity is obsolete

   Hopefully some mommy blogger like me will say, “look at that old study
   from 2009, when they thought that being a housewife didn’t matter. How
   quaint.”
