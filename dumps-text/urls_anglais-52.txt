Is TikTok housewives trend encouraging women to be 'submissive'?

   A TikTok trend of stay-at-home moms sharing their daily routine of
   performing domestic work has prompted a debate about whether it
   encourages women to be submissive.

   As Insider reported earlier this month, women showcasing their lives as
   homemakers is part of a trend of American women making “trad wife”
   (traditional wife) content showing the positive aspects of being a
   housewife. The trad wife hashtag has more than 96 million views on
   TikTok, with some users incorporating it into their usernames.

   Estee C. Williams, a 24-year-old who creates content for TikTok,
   defines trad wife as a woman “who chooses to live a more traditional
   life with ultra-traditional gender roles."

   Williams lives in Virginia with her husband, Conner. In June, the
   homemaker posted a video listing all the things she does to make her
   life more enjoyable, including listening to music while cleaning,
   wearing makeup and cute house dresses, and taking candle-lit baths.

   In an interview with Insider, Williams said she is not disparaging
   women’s right to work, but adds that housewives like her believe many
   “women have drifted far from [our] roots.”

   "For me, the hustle culture was not appealing. Being a wife, mom,
   making delicious home-cooked meals for my family, and keeping up a
   warm, inviting home is what truly spoke to me,” Williams said.

   The social media influencer added that working can be good for some
   women, but fears many in the workforce suffer from burnout.

   "I choose to promote this lifestyle to showcase the fulfillment this
   lifestyle gives,” she said.

   According to a 2020 analysis conducted by Great Place to Work and
   healthcare start-up Maven, mothers in paid employment are 23% more
   likely to experience burnout than fathers in paid employment.

   The study surveyed over 1,200 U.S. companies and over 400,000 working
   parents. The analysis included 226,000 working mothers and 204,000
   working fathers, having them respond to 60 questions through Great
   Place to Work’s Trust Index survey.

   An estimated 2.35 million working mothers in the U.S. suffered from
   burnout during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly “due to
   unequal demands of home and work,” according to the study.

   Another survey conducted by the business networking site LinkedIn
   assessed nearly 5,000 members on the site between July 31 and Aug. 13
   last year. The study found that while working women and men face
   similar stresses, the intensity level was always higher for women.

   Seventy-four percent of women said they felt “very or somewhat
   stressed” for work-related reasons, compared to 64% of working men.

   Forty percent of working women cited “not having enough time in the day
   to get everything done” as one of their top stress factors, versus just
   35% of male respondents.

   The Insider report noted that some trad wives believe that feminism has
   persuaded women to enter the workforce instead of being full-time wives
   and mothers. Deborah Etienne, a Brandwatch data analyst and researcher
   tracking the social media trend, asserted that "many trad wives reject
   feminism, claiming it has destroyed everything."

   Whitman College sociologist Michelle Janning told Insider that the
   chaos of the pandemic might have influenced some women to be full-time
   stay-at-home mothers. According to Janning, the stress of working
   outside the home during this time might have led some women to decide
   that being at home was the best option.

   "As a sociologist, I would say, when people collectively feel like
   there's not a lot of control in the world, you cling to something
   familiar, and concrete because it might be comfortable," she told
   Insider.

   Janning also cautioned that not all trad wives are creating content to
   promote homemaking as a healthy lifestyle. She claimed that some might
   use the trend to champion "conservative or white supremacist views."
   Another TikTok user that once identified as a trad wife, Madison
   Dastrup, stopped associating with the term in September for this
   reason.

   The sociologist further added that some of these women on TikTok are
   actually pursuing a career “outside the home” by working as social
   media influencers.

   "It could be that they're not selling a product but selling a version
   of themselves, and their husband will be getting the sponsorship,”
   Janning said. “It's a contradiction: their job is to tell people they
   don't have a job."

   She went on to insinuate that society’s “gender system” tells women
   that being a homemaker is a lifestyle choice, but it’s really pushing
   them toward the role of a full-time housewife.

   "It's less of a choice than maybe we think it is,” Janning said.

   Abby Roth, a conservative and host of the "Classically Abby" podcast,
   which promotes classic feminist values, examined the #TradWide trend in
   a May 2020 article at Evie. Roth claimed that some versions of the
   trend “demean women” instead of merely celebrating stay-at-home moms.

   Some definitions of the trend, Roth explained, claim that women can
   only be traditional if they stay home full-time.

   “A classic woman can be a traditional wife and mother even if she does
   work because she knows that her passion for her work is there to
   support her traditional life at home,” she wrote. “Where feminism
   proposes that women should actively choose career over family, being
   classic says that work and family can go hand-in-hand.”

   The feminist emphasized that a husband and wife must commit to growing
   alongside one another, encouraging each other to become better versions
   of themselves. She argued that the #Trad trend appears to discourage
   women from speaking to their husbands about how to improve their
   character.

   “Because this #Trad definition expects wives to be submissive and
   husbands to be dominant, it creates an inherent power imbalance in the
   relationship,” Roth wrote at the time.

   She asserted that marriages “should be based on partnership, not
   subservience.”

   According to a YouGov survey from the Institute for Family
   Studies/Wheatley Institution of 2,500 American adults, ages 18-55,
   conducted from May 28 to June 10 last year, 53% of parents with
   children younger than 18 prefer working from home most of the time or
   half of the time due to the pandemic.

   Sixty-five percent of college-educated fathers supported the idea of
   working from home at least half the time or most of the time.
   Approximately 44% supported working from home most of the time, while
   21% support working from home half of the time. Among college-educated
   mothers, some 57% endorse the shift.

   Mothers were more likely than fathers to voice a preference for having
   flexible work hours and sharing childcare responsibilities with their
   partners. Nearly 30% of moms and dads believe one parent staying home
   full-time is the “best arrangement” for children under 5.

   The researchers behind the survey concluded that their results support
   the idea that most parents caring for their children themselves if
   their work arrangement allows it.
