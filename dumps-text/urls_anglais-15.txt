‘I want to submit to my husband like a 50s housewife’: inside the
controversial UK tradwife movement

   The tradwife movement is one of the most concerning trends to have
   emerged in the past few years, with more and more women looking to
   switch their careers and independence for tending to hearth and home –
   and every will of their husbands. But why? Stylist investigates.

   Jenny Smith* was 23 and working long days as a finance administrator
   when she read a book that changed her life.

   “Most of my friends wanted to have it all – career, partner, family –
   but I’d always secretly aspired to be a homemaker,” she says. “I loved
   gingham aprons and Doris Day, while women my age preferred the
   footballer’s wives look, all big hair and big handbags. I always felt
   out of step with the modern world.”

   The book was The Fascinating Girl, a 60s advice manual that counsels
   women that the ‘proper’ way to find a husband is to perfect their
   repertoire of domestic skills and be ‘childlike’ and ultra-feminine.

   “The chapter about how to make a man feel loved and valued by building
   a homely home really spoke to me,” Jenny says. “It validated my life
   goals.”

   The tradwives movement is, remarkably, gaining thousands of followers
   in countries as diverse as the UK, Brazil, Germany and Japan.

   Today Jenny, 33, who is based in Doncaster* and a stepmother to two
   teens, aged 18 and 14, by her husband Dave*, is a proud #tradwife. She
   is part of a growing online and real-life movement that rejects the
   worldview of modern feminism and instead proposes that a woman’s route
   to happiness lies in pursuit of an ‘ideal’ femininity and domestic
   submission.

     “Women should aspire to an ideal femininity, manipulate men with
     their ‘feminine charms’ and see wifely subordination as the
     foundation of a happy marriage”

   Tradwifehood is, remarkably, gaining thousands of followers in
   countries as diverse as the UK, Brazil, Germany and Japan. The movement
   has star bloggers such as The Transformed Wife and The Vintage Mrs, who
   dish out advice on everything from baking cakes according to 50s
   recipes to ‘using girlishness to get your way’.

   Hashtags #tradwife, #tradfem and #vintagehousewife regularly trend on
   social media as would-be tradwives congregate in Facebook groups with
   names such as Women of Traditional Values and Make Traditional
   Housewives Great Again. Many tradwives are also vintage homecraft
   enthusiasts, rejecting technologies such as TVs and microwaves in
   favour of cooking from scratch and a modest lifestyle, or as they call
   it, the #tradlife.

   Worryingly, aspiring tradwives can now sign up for Fascinating
   Womanhood classes in the UK.

   The #tradwife lodestar is Fascinating Womanhood. Written by Helen
   Andelin, an American Mormon mother of eight, the 1963 book argues that
   women should aspire to an ideal femininity, manipulate men with their
   ‘feminine charms’ and see wifely subordination as the foundation of a
   happy marriage. It quickly became known as ‘the book feminists love to
   hate’.

   In 1969, Andelin followed her femininity advice manual with a book
   addressed to single women, The Fascinating Girl, the book that led
   Jenny to traditional wifehood (and in 1972 her husband Aubrey published
   a book on ideal ‘masculine development’: Man of Steel and Velvet).

     “We say to feminists: thanks for the trousers, but we see life a
     different way”

   In a sign of the renewed interest in ‘trad’ femininity, Fascinating
   Womanhood, now a teaching business run by Andelin’s daughter Dixie
   Andelin Forsyth, has relaunched the movement’s 70s ‘femininity classes’
   as both real-world and online affairs. Over 100,000 women are signed up
   to these classes worldwide, including hundreds of women in the UK.
   Modules include feminine presentation (for example, instructions not to
   dress in scruffy ‘pizza eating clothes’ or in any way that could be
   considered lesbian) and how to behave in order to attract and keep a
   man (in short: puff up his ego, bat your eyelashes and don’t put out
   too quickly).

   “The movement’s rising because women have had enough of feminism in the
   UK and elsewhere,” Dixie Andelin Forsyth tells Stylist of the surprise
   resurgence of interest in her mother’s 60s book. “We say to feminists:
   thanks for the trousers, but we see life a different way.”

     “Fascinating Womanhood courses cover such topics as ‘ideal
     womanhood’, ‘femininity’, ‘childlikeness’ and ‘understanding,
     accepting, admiring and appreciating men’”

   The first accredited Fascinating Womanhood teacher in the UK, who calls
   herself Homekeeping Heart, launched her classes in 2018. The 10-session
   group classes, available online or in-person in the North of England,
   cover such topics as ‘ideal womanhood’, ‘femininity’, ‘childlikeness’
   and ‘understanding, accepting, admiring and appreciating men’. They
   cost £129, or £189 including three one-on-one sessions. There has been
   interest in the courses ‘from across the UK’.

   South London based Jade Lola*, 33, also felt at odds with the world
   until she discovered the #tradwife community. “My parents are Nigerian
   and quite leftwing,” she says. “But even as a teenager I was attracted
   to TV programmes like Little House on the Prairie and The Waltons, with
   their traditional mums and dads and loads of happy kids.”

   Why is the tradwife movement gaining popularity in the UK?

   Jade, who is single and works as an administrator in the City of
   London, came across the movement through the feeds of rightwing Youtube
   and Twitter stars in the US, such as Mormon blogger Ayla Stewart, aka
   Wife With A Purpose. She immediately felt at home.

   It was through one of Stewart’s posts that Jade heard about the 1963
   Fascinating Womanhood book. She bought a copy online and liked its
   advice about how women should be demure and make men feel like real
   men. “I changed my style to be more feminine, dropped my habit of
   wearing trousers and started to cover up my cleavage,” Jade recalls,
   adding that she now aspires to find a ‘trad’ man who’ll support her
   while she stays at home. It’s not an easy feat, she admits, when you’re
   app dating in the UK. “Men can be scared off when you tell them that
   you want to be a traditional housewife.” Jade now hopes to use online
   dating to meet a man in the US, where the #tradlife movement is more
   established.

     “It’s easy to think that a retreat to grandma’s apron is the cure
     for all our problems”

   The question, of course, is why? Why, a full 40 years since Second Wave
   feminists called out the myth that domestic subordination was the only
   means to women’s fulfillment, are so many British women attracted to
   these narratives?

   In her 1989 book Backlash, feminist author Susan Faludi documents the
   antifeminist ‘feminity movements’ that have followed each wave of
   feminism, from the suffragettes to the Second Wave. “The backlash
   remarkets old myths about women as new facts and ignores all appeals to
   reason,” Faludi concludes.

   Social psychologist Dr Sandra Wheatley, meanwhile, believes today’s
   tradwife trend speaks to our socially turbulent times. “We only
   remember the good bits of the past, such as the warm kitchens and
   cuddles from grandma,” she explains. “It’s an easy step from this to
   think that a retreat to grandma’s apron is the cure for all our
   problems.”

   Tradwives: “I love cooking for my husband and young daughter, and
   tending hearth and home"

   For Leeds-based tradwife Christine Warren*, 28, the attraction of the
   tradwifehood is precisely this cosy imagined past. “I love cooking for
   my husband and young daughter, and tending hearth and home. And my
   husband loves being taken care of. It just feels that that traditional
   gender roles are the right way to live.”

   Christine got into the movement through the 40s vintage scene, picking
   up tea dresses and skirt suits at vintage stores and finding
   communities of fellow enthusiasts in online groups such as The
   Authentic 1940s Fashion Forum. “I realised I liked the morals of the
   era too,” Christine explains. “The idea that you should marry before
   having children, have one marriage and make that marriage work.”

     “Tradwife Facebook groups bristle with posts about women who’ve
     given up work to ‘spoil’ their husbands ‘like 50s housewives’”

   Christine is not alone in finding that an obsession with vintage
   fashion was a stepping stone to socially conservative attitudes towards
   gender roles. Tradwife Facebook groups bristle with posts about women
   who’ve given up work to ‘spoil’ their husbands ‘like 50s housewives’
   (“Oooh I would give up work to spoil my hub IN A HEARTBEAT,” reads a
   typical response on the forum Being A Vintage Housewife).

   Some 40s housewife enthusiasts take the lifestyle a step further and
   live the #HomeFront life, cooking from World War II rationing recipes
   and even retrofitting their homes to the 40s and 50s, ripping out
   central heating and installing outside loos. Fascinating Womanhood’s
   femininity classes capitalise on this retro mystique, detailing three
   ‘ideal’ fashion looks: dramatic (exemplified by Elizabeth Taylor);
   classic (Jackie O; Audrey Hepburn); and romantic (the ruffles and bows
   of an early 80s Princess Diana).

   Tradwives: “For me the movement is about feminine self-improvement.”

   Central to #tradwifehood’s message is the notion that feminism, with
   its questioning of the ‘traditional’ sexed roles, has gone too far.
   “Tell men not to be men and women not to be women and you get family
   breakdown,” says Jade of this way of thinking. Tradwives are often wary
   of talking about their beliefs on social media for fear of being
   trolled by what they perceive as an enemy feminist majority (it’s for
   this reason that we agreed to conceal interviewees’ surnames for this
   story). “People who want to live a traditional lifestyle get a load of
   abuse,” Christine explains. “People just don’t get us, I guess”.

   Like many #tradwives, Jade lives a double identity, keeping her real
   beliefs about men, women and marriage for sympathetic tradwife friends
   and forums. For several years she posted to a YouTube channel, but took
   it down after receiving ‘a lot of flack’ about her attitudes to men,
   women and marriage. “I don’t really have an issue with feminists,
   although I do have a problem with anyone who doesn’t respect my
   choices,” Jade explains. “They say feminism is about choice, but I
   don’t always see that.”

     “Is this a harmless social media trend, up there with Rickrolling
     and grumpy cats, or a sinister shortcut to Gilead?”

   Jenny, who says that friends and family see her as “quaint and
   grandmotherly”, feels that the traditional womanhood movement is
   broadly misunderstood. “People take a passage from Fascinating
   Womanhood out of context, or they think we want women to be powerless
   and downtrodden,” she says. “For me the movement is about feminine
   self-improvement.”

   Whether you think its brand of pre-feminist nostalgia is a harmless
   social media trend, up there with Rickrolling and grumpy cats, or a
   sinister shortcut to Gilead, the #tradwife #tradlife is here to stay.
   Fascinating Womanhood plans ‘a big push’ into Europe, East Asia and
   Russia in the coming year and Dixie Andelin’s follow-up book to the
   1963 original, Fascinating Womanhood for the Timeless Woman, which adds
   chapters on step parenthood and working women, recently made it onto
   Amazon’s worldwide digital bestseller list.

     “I simply think the old ways were better: when men provided and
     protected and women took care of their men”

   Every week sees the arrival of a new tradwife forum online, full of
   posts about ‘finding joy’ in household chores. The rise of
   ultra-feminine social media ‘cleanflunecers’ such as Mrs Hinch and The
   Organised Mum can also be seen as part of the same trad backlash.

   “When I tell modern women that my ambition is to be a trad wife they
   say; ‘why would you do that when women have fought for years to get out
   of the kitchen’?” Jade muses. “I simply think the old ways were better:
   when men provided and protected and women took care of their men. I
   just ask not to be judged.”
