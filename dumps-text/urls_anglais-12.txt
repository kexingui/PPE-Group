The stigma of a housewife

   The stigma of a housewife

   Read on to find out why this term is being seen as an insult and evokes
   negative emotions from today’s women
   Over the years, the divide between generations has only grown and that
   probably will explain why the older lot is at sea when the younger
   generation (especially married women) abhor the term ‘housewife’.
   Housewife v/s homemaker: While there is nothing wrong with the word per
   se, it’s what that term has come to represent; that women have a
   problem with says clinical psychologist Dr Seema Hingorrany. She says,
   “Our facets of personality are shaped by conditioning since childhood.
   It is called ‘learned behaviour’. One of the thought processes
   conditioned within us is that housewives don’t have their own identity
   and are always dependent on their spouses, financially and
   emotionally.”

   The housewife-serial connection A housewife is generally portrayed as a
   woman who is unsatisfied with her being or is watching soap operas all
   day. This concept is based on the premise that since a housewife does
   not go out of the house to earn an income, even if she has the
   qualifications to do so, then she must be indolent. This becomes even
   more glaring when she always has to ask her spouse for finances so she
   can run the house. Women don’t like to be called housewives because
   they feel it is a label of being inferior vis-a-vis women who are
   working.
   Why does one word evoke varied emotions like anger, disgust and pity?

   Clinical psychologist and psychotherapist, Varkha Chulani, claims it’s
   linguistics at play, and they are vital for our emotional well-being.
   She adds, “A person who is a housewife is ‘just’ that — a housewife.
   The meaning often attributed to that term is a person who doesn’t do
   much! A home-maker on the other hand is looked upon as person, who
   makes, creates, tends to, look after — the attribution to that term is
   one where the word is seen as more meaningful, more contributing. While
   in the former, the word doesn’t have the same connotation.” Ruchi
   Sinha, a working professional agrees, and adds, “While our grandmothers
   were proud of keeping a household together, today’s woman wants to be
   able to do much more than that. When I got married, I took a break from
   work for a while. And wherever I went I was asked about what I do. The
   term ‘housewife’ would get different reactions. While some would look
   at me with disdain others did probe further to find out if I was simply
   lazy or had no ambition in life. The term itself has now got a negative
   connotation and is often associated with women who don’t want to work
   and would rather live off their partners.”

   Seema adds, “My client Roma (name changed) refers to this as the
   housewife stigma because the term describes what a woman traditionally
   did within the four walls of her house. This includes cooking, cleaning
   and taking care of kids), which is not really valued by society. She
   feels that homemaker is a sophisticated word, and does imply that wives
   are not just sitting doing nothing but are fulfiling many domestic
   responsibilities. Most housewives are undervalued by their partners and
   by society at large. We forget that even though they are not being
   paid, the job they do cannot be quantified.”
