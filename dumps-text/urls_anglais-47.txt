Let’s be proud of the women making their life decisions of their free will,
whether they choose to fly a plane 30,000 feet above sea level or to run a
home the way they wish. They never needed your permission anyway.

   My mother is an urban woman who had an English-medium education. She
   has Bachelors and Master’s degrees in Arts, and is a voracious reader.
   She’s never shied away from speaking her mind and has almost never been
   politically correct. The word “diplomatic” doesn’t exist in my mother’s
   dictionary. She wears whatever she likes whenever she likes, others’
   opinions be damned. She stands her own ground in arguments no matter
   who’s at the other end, seldom puts up with people’s nonsense (she
   gives it back in equal measure), and has always been a self-assured
   woman. She’s one of the most confident people I’ve ever known, forever
   comfortable in her 61-year-old skin.

   My mother is also a housewife by choice, and has been one since the day
   she got married.

   Surprised? More often than not, we think of the housewives around us –
   whether mothers, grandmothers, aunts or neighbours – as though cut from
   the same domesticated cloth. Many from the millennial generation think
   that all they do is cater to their husbands, houses, and kids, and
   otherwise just “do nothing at all”.  Even the movies we grew up on show
   homemakers as in-law-worshipping, always submissive to their husbands
   and families, weak, and rarely opinionated or having strong
   personalities, or any personality at all. Thanks, Bollywood. But why
   can’t we showcase, or be okay with, badass women choosing to be
   housewives?

   I’ve asked my mom on many occasions, like we tend to question most
   homemakers, whether she’s ever dreamt of pursuing a career or having an
   income. “Do you think you were brought up just on money? I provided
   everything else,” comes the proud response. My mother was perfectly
   happy being the provider of everything apart for the salary – her
   ambition was to be a mother, at any and every time her kids needed her.
   She did work before she got married, first teaching at a kindergarten
   and then at a desk job for a while, but never developed a liking for
   the work life. She’s never regretted her choice, or let anyone make her
   feel ashamed or guilty for it. And we shouldn’t either.

   What’s it that they do at home? Till my brother and I were almost
   adults, we didn’t have a driver, a cook, or full-time domestic help. It
   was my mom – like countless other homemakers – who travelled by BEST
   buses to drop and fetch us from birthday parties and swimming classes,
   walked to bazaars to stock up the kitchen and cook our meals, helped
   with our homework whenever needed, attended all PTA meetings,
   accompanied us to the doctor, and cared for us when we were sick. And
   she still made time for herself – to read, do her beloved newspaper
   crosswords and sudokus, meet friends, shop, write her daily diary, or
   do whatever else she wanted.

     If women who choose to be housewives are truly owning it, who are we
     to look down at them?

   From a young age, my brother and I were taught to be independent and
   self-reliant, my mom forcing me to travel alone by bus by the age of 10
   so that I didn’t need her to fetch me from friends’ houses. She stayed
   out of our sibling fights “because you need to learn to deal with
   problems yourself”, and made both my brother and me do several
   household chores (PSA: kids are “free house help” for middle-class
   families). She taught me to fill pass books and do the rounds of banks
   for financial work in the pre-netbanking era. I could go to her for any
   questions I had about boys, periods, sex, and everything else under the
   sun, even if they got a little weird. And no matter how many times I
   asked if she’d ever had great ambitions outside the four walls of our
   home, she had only one answer: that she was happiest being a homemaker,
   and had no qualms wearing that badge with pride.

   If women who choose to be housewives are truly owning it, who are we to
   look down at them? We shame our kind for choosing to “sit at home and
   do nothing” (have you ever seen a housewife’s schedule?), or assume
   that she’s confined to the home life because of outside factors – not
   having qualifications or finding a job, family objections or because
   she’s unambitious. Why can’t we treat the homemakers around us with the
   same respect that we give that CEO who’s killing it in the boardroom or
   the lawyer who spends hours poring over her case files?

   There are those though, who say that being a housewife is the most
   thankless unpaid job, and that once in a while we should express our
   gratitude to the ladies who spend all their days at home, for
   everything they do for us. But all they need is the same respect one
   gives a career-woman for the choices she makes – for isn’t that what
   feminism is all about? Let’s be proud of the women making their life
   decisions of their free will, whether they choose to fly a plane 30,000
   feet above sea level or to run a home the way they wish. They never
   needed your permission anyway. At least my mom doesn’t.
