Dad Asks If He's Wrong For 'Encouraging' His Daughter To Be A Housewife

   A 24-year-old father is struggling to raise his daughter that he had
   when he was only 19, and as such, does his best to support her in
   everything that she says and does in order to keep her happy.

   When the five-year-old girl was cycling through the future jobs she
   wanted as most five-year-olds do, one of the ones she landed on got her
   father in trouble with his neighbors.

The father was called out for “encouraging” his daughter to become a
housewife.

   “Everyday has been a struggle and most of the time I don't even know if
   what I am doing is right so the thought of unintentionally hurting my
   daughter is filling me with guilt,” wrote the father on the subreddit
   “r/AmItheA--hole” (AITA).

   AITA is a Reddit forum for people who are unsure if they’re doing the
   right thing.

   People will post their problems, their arguments with family, their
   struggles with raising children, or whatever else is ailing them in the
   hopes that the strangers perusing the site will give their unbiased
   opinion that will hopefully validate their decisions.

   Posts are given a rating, the most common ones being “You’re The
   A--hole” (YTA) and “Not The A--hole” (NTA), but there are other ones
   just in case things are a little more complicated than they seem.

   “My daughter is at that stage where kids pretend they are grown-ups
   with jobs,” the father wrote.

   “The jobs differ depending on who she meets or sees on the TV. In the
   last few months, she wanted to be a teacher, babysitter, truck driver,
   president, garbage collector, photographer, ‘knee doctor’ (after I
   injured it), scientist, witch, [and] football steward.”

   Like any father of a five-year-old child, he did his best to support
   her by playing along, buying her anything he could afford that would
   help her play the role.

   When an old friend of his came to visit and revealed that she was a
   housewife, the five-year-old cycled to her new profession.

   He explains that his daughter has now started playing house and
   expressing her interest in being a housewife.

   &embed=true&showmedia=false&theme=dark

   When his neighbors caught wind of the situation, however, they were
   angry with him.

   “They told me we aren't in the 60s anymore and young girls shouldn't
   dream about being [housewives] anymore and demanded I stop brainwashing
   my daughter because her subconscious will start settling for being a
   housewife instead of dreaming about bigger things,” he wrote.

   Fortunately, Reddit was on his side and even commended his parenting
   efforts.

   Many sympathized with him, offering up the commonly-known but hardly
   spoken fact that all parents are winging it and hoping that it goes
   right.

   Being a parent is very difficult. Maintaining another human’s happiness
   all while trying to teach them the right things, behave in the right
   way, and express themselves in a healthy manner, is no easy feat.

   The fact that he’s supporting her in the way that he is was enough for
   the majority of Redditors to give him the NTA rating because a lot of
   parents don’t even do the bare minimum of supporting their children’s
   dreams.

   Plus, she’s only five years old.
