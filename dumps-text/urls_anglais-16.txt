   5 practical ideas to implement SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and
   empower women and girls by starting with your own wife.

   Some men pronounce themselves publicly in favor of women’s rights and
   gender equality. They might even call themselves feminists or fight in
   organisations, devoted to the implementation of the SDGs.

   In theory, it sure does sound good to be a supporter of women. However,
   when looking at their own homes, they might not always treat their wife
   and partner with the respect they deserve.

   In this article, we would like to draw a closer look to implementing
   gender equality at home in your relationship.

   What does it mean to have a marriage that is based on the principle of
   gender equality? Which strategies and values will help a couple to live
   the gender equality demanded by SDG5?

   (And by the way, for the men among you who like being the “boss” of the
   family: You have no idea what you are actually missing in your
   relationship :-)).

   Our five practical suggestions should give you the possibility to
   critically reflect on subconscious behaviours in your couple.

   Number 1: Let’s talk about money!

   Who earns more money in your relationship? Even the most
   forward-thinking men don’t like to admit that their wives earn more
   money. But why is that? Is it difficult for men to be proud when their
   wives are professionally successful? Doesn’t that mean that they have
   made a good choice by marrying an intelligent partner?

   Money can often be intimidating. Then there are questions of joint bank
   accounts, credit cards and so on. Whatever you decide, just make sure
   that you discuss it first. Be honest about your feelings.

   If your partner’s money intimidates you, just say so. If you feel like
   earning more money or changing your career path, this is more than
   legitimate. When planning bigger investments, make the decisions
   together.

   If you want to be financially independent, that’s also fine. Just keep
   in mind: Your relationship shouldn’t be about money. Money doesn’t
   define you or your ability. Equality in a relationship means that both
   partners can earn money, but it doesn’t matter who earns more of it.

   Number 2: Let’s talk about sex!

   Let’s not deny it: Good sex is an important part of a good
   relationship. But who defines what good sex is?

   In a relationship based on equality partners not only have sex, but
   they also talk about it. Sometimes the talking part can even be more
   intimate than the actual sex.

   Sex should be about discovering your partner’s body and your partner’s
   wishes and desires. An orgasm is not a one-way-street, nor is it the
   ultimate goal of every intercourse. Much more than that, sexuality is a
   way of getting closer together, to create an intimate space for the two
   of you.

   Equality in sexuality means that nobody is left behind. It also means
   that both partners can refuse intercourse whenever they don’t feel like
   it. And it signifies that the pleasure of both partners is equally
   important.

   So, go ahead and talk about it. And it includes menstruation and surely
   contraception, which is a matter for both partners.

   Number 3: Let’s talk about kids!

   Whenever kids come to play in a relationship, things become more
   complex. A new role distribution has to take place. Although it should
   be normal that mothers and fathers take over the same responsibilities
   in the 21^st century, many families seem to be back to the stone age
   after the birth of a child.

   Why can’t both, Mum and Dad, wash the baby, change nappies, feed their
   child, wake up at night and so forth? If a mother is still
   breastfeeding, that doesn’t mean that the Dad cannot take other
   responsibilities to make up for it: take the child for a walk, bring
   his partner some water to drink while breastfeeding or prepare dinner.

   Caring for a child is a lot of work. It is equally rewarding to see how
   close relationships mostly grow between children with a Dad who is
   present to do all the things that were just enumerated.

   Dads who are away most of the time, miss out on a lot of great things.
   Of course, it is okay to return to work after childbirth. However, this
   right should apply to mothers and fathers equally.

   Women often sacrifice their careers or are condemned to a life-lasting
   part-time job that doesn’t fulfill them. The most important thing is to
   discuss where you want to go with your life and who takes which
   responsibilities.

   Number 4: Let’s talk about support!

   Being in a relationship based on equality doesn’t mean that you have to
   want the same things all the time. However, the key word here is:
   support!

   Your partner wants to open a creative online-shop – just go for it! You
   can express your opinion about it by being supportive at the same time.
   Be happy for your partner’s success and accompany him or her to achieve
   his or her goals.

   Number 5: Let’s talk about us!

   The key to any successful relationship, based on gender equality
   supported by mutual respect, is communication. Communication sometimes
   means the ability to put behind your personal anger and your needs and
   to express your thoughts with words.

   Whenever something is bothering you, you should bring it to the
   attention of your partner in a respectful way. A regular sit-together
   can help you discuss important aspects of your relationship and of your
   life as a couple.
