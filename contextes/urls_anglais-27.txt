   Housewife 'would be paid £30,000'

   Clothes Pegs
   Nearly three-quarters of those polled said it was a full-time job

   Housewives would be paid more than the average worker if they received
   the going rate for their household chores, a survey has suggested.

   A poll of 4,000 housewives for networking website alljoinon.com
   suggested that the average mum worked for nearly nine hours a day every
   day.

   The website said a housewife would earn almost £30,000 a year if she
   was employed to do all the same errands.

   home was a full-time job.

   "The survey clearly demonstrates that not only do housewives deserve a
   wage for their efforts, they also need a break from the daily grind,"
   said Carolyn Morris, spokeswoman for alljoinon.com.

   Fourteen minutes making the beds is worth £1.29 for a chambermaid, and
   a kitchen assistant would be paid £2.57 for a housewife's typical 28
   minutes of washing up.
