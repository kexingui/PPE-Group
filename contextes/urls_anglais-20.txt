   Politicizing the Housewife
   November 1, 2001
   By Wendy McElroy

   What it means to be a housewife is being revised ideologically in order
   to impugn the choice some mothers make to stay at home.

   issue, Playing God on No Sleep, the Pulitzerprize-winning Anna
   Quindlen argued that every mother secretly identified with killing her
   own children. She described the typical stay-at-home housewife this
   way: Shes tired, shes hot and shes been up all night throwing
   sheets into the washer because the smaller of her two boys has

   potential, the next leap of logic is easy. Murdering moms are driven to
   violence by the men who impregnate them and trap them in the
   psychologically devastating role of housewife. Thus many voices in the
   media blame Andrea Yatess husbanda man whom no one has suggested was
   ever violenteven while they express sympathy for Andrea herself. They

Friedan Called into Question

   Interestingly, the current debate about housewifery comes at the same
   time as the validity of the book that sparked the original debate is
   being severely questioned. In 1963 Betty Friedans book The Feminine
   Mystique, spoke of the problem that has no name. Stated simply,
   domesticity denied housewives their humanity and potential, making them
   suffer both physically and mentally. Friedan described the typical 50s
   family as a comfortable concentration camp. Like camp inmates,
   suburban housewives had adjusted psychologically and become dependent,
   passive, childlike and lived at a lower human level.

   during which women flooded out of the home into the university and the
   workplace. As women continued to read Friedans book, the idea of
   housewifery as a pathology was cemented to feminism.

   Recent works have thoroughly discredited Friedans arguments, the power

   and the Making of the Feminine Mystique (1998), Daniel Horowitz
   explored Friedans background and debunked the myth that she ever
   represented the typical suburban housewife as she has persistently
   claimed. Friedan had been a staunch political activist on the communist
   left for decades before her first book appeared. Horowitzs analysis is

   The fact that readers of Friedans book identified with her as a
   sister-housewife who had naïvely bought into the domesticity myth was
   one reason for The Feminine Mystiques huge success. The same
   readership would never have identified with the real Friedan: a
--
   subset of the New Left.

   In addition to questions about Friedans credentials as a housewife,
   grave doubt has been cast both on her interpretation of the experts on
   which The Feminine Mystique was based and the facts presented by the

   Without the backing of solid statistics and research, Friedans work
   does nothing more than offer anecdotal evidence of the unhappiness of
   some housewives and then proceeds to define the reality of most on that
   basis.

   Despite the criticism, however, it is undeniably true that The Feminine
   Mystique spoke to many women whose lives were changed as a result of
   reading the book. For them, being a housewife was a negation of their
   potential as human beings, and they discovered the courage to reach out
   to make a different choice. But voices within feminism were not content
   to view domesticity simply as a choice that appealed to some women and
   not to others. So a new political mythology of housewifery was born.

The Myth of the Housewife

   In the 60s the mainstream of feminism was liberal and contained a

   A new theory of the housewife was evolving in which the role had the
   political status of chattel. To gender feminists, marriage and the
   family became inextricably bound up with private property, the class

   relegated to the roles of breeding, maintaining men, and buying
   consumer goods. Mothers provided the next and appropriately
   indoctrinated generation of laborers for the capitalists; housewives
   maintained the male workforce by cleaning and cooking; housekeepers
   enriched the capitalist structure by consuming the products it

   Thrown into this economic condemnation of housework and the traditional
   family as bastions of capitalism are other accusations. For example,
   housewives are said to be kept in an isolation that encourages domestic
   violence.

A New/Old View of Housewifery

   Fortunately, voices of sanity remain. One of them belongs to Mimi
--
   Individualist feminism views staying at home to raise a family as a
   choice every bit as valid as entering the work force. Gladsteins essay
   begins, We dont hire housewives, because that is the response she
   received when she asked about joining the faculty of the University of
   Texas at El Paso, where she is now associate dean of liberal arts.
   Gladstein refused to be devalued as a human being because she was a
   housewife. That jobno less than teaching university
   Englishexpressed her worth and her competence. Even more, being a
   housewife was the training ground where she learned skills such as
   setting priorities and budgeting time. Gladstein writes, All I really
   needed to know about chairing a department, I learned by being a Jewish
   Mother.

   Gladstein describes how being a suburban housewife trained her to
   handle taking over as executive director of her universitys Diamond
   Jubilee celebration. She writes, That job allowed me to use my
   housewifery skills to create and manage events as diverse as football
   half-times, city-wide street festivals, physics fairs, student
   retention programs, Vietnam Memorial dedications, city and university
