Not Just a Housewife

   In this week's Spot, Sadhguru posts an excerpt from a recent "In
   Conversation" with Juhi Chawla on the question of motherhood and

   They say, “'Oh, I am just a housewife...' They do not seem to
   understand the significance of being able to nurture two or three new
   lives." Sadhguru describes the responsibility and beauty of being a
   mother, and about whether mothers should also have a career. Enjoy!
